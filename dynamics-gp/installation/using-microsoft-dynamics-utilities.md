# Using Microsoft Dynamics Utilities

[!INCLUDE [azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

After you've installed Dynamics GP, you need to complete a number of additional configuration procedures. To do this, you'll use an application called [!INCLUDE[gputilities](../includes/gputilities.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> One of the most important—and difficult to change later—configuration tasks is setting up an account framework. So before you start using the [!INCLUDE[gputilities](../includes/gputilities.md)], see [Account framework](account-framework.md).

## [!INCLUDE[gputilities](../includes/gputilities.md)] overview

You'll use [!INCLUDE[gputilities](../includes/gputilities.md)] to complete the following tasks after you've installed software and data on a server computer.

- Select whether to use default or custom settings to configure the system database.

- Create SQL Server databases for Dynamics GP.

- Deploy predefined SQL Server Reporting Services reports that are included in Dynamics GP.

- Deploy predefined Microsoft Excel reports that are included in Dynamics GP.

- Create your account framework and synchronize the Dynamics GP dictionary, if you are providing custom settings.

- Select a default account framework and synchronize the Dynamics GP dictionary, if you decide to use default settings.

- Define account sorting options, if you are providing custom settings.

- Enter the password for the DYNSA user.

- Set up the system password, which controls access to system management functions in Dynamics GP, if you are providing custom settings.

- Synchronize sample data with your account framework, if you installed the sample company.

- Remove SOP and Invoicing message. This lets you removes a message that appears every time you enter a transaction in Sales Order Processing or Invoicing, if both modules are registered.

- Create a SQLServer login for Dynamics GP Web Client

- Select the authentication type for the Dynamics GP Web Client.

- Create additional companies, as needed.

## Installation options in Dynamics Utilities

When using [!INCLUDE[gputilities](../includes/gputilities.md)], you can select an installation option to use default settings or to provide your own custom settings. If you select the Basic option, the default settings for the system database, the account framework, and system password are provided. If you select the Advanced option, you'll provide the settings to create the database, the account framework, and system password.

The following table compares the default settings of the Basic option with the custom settings of the Advanced option.

| Setting           | Basic installation   | Advanced installation   |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| System database   | The system database files are created at the default locations defined in the SQL Server. A typical default location is \\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL\\dat.|You can specify the locations where the system database files are created in SQL Server. |
| Account framework | The following account framework is created for you. </br>Maximum number of segments: 5 </br> Maximum Account Length: 45 </br>Length of each segment: 9</br>  Sorting Options: No sorting options by segment </br> Account preview: xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx   | You can design your account framework by entering the maximum for the account length, the number of account segments, and the length of each segment. You also can select sorting options. For more information about designing an account framework, see [Account framework](account-framework.md). |
| System password   | The system password is blank. This means that all users will have access to system-wide setup information. You can enter this password in Dynamics GP. | You can enter a password for system-wide setup information. |

## Managing the Web Client SQL Server login

Use the Manage Web Client SQL Server Login window to create or modify a SQL Server login for Dynamics GP Web Client. By using the single Web Client SQL Server login, each web client user can access the web client by providing their standard Windows login credentials instead of using their own SQL Server login.

During the initial Dynamics GP installation, you can create the SQL Server login. Each web client session can use the login to access SQL Server.

To manage the Web Client SQL Server login:

1. Select the Manage Web Client SQL Server Login option in the Additional Tasks window and click Process.

2. In the Manage Web Client SQL Server Login window, specify the SQL Server

Login and password for the Web Client SQL Server login.

3. If the login has an existing password, you can mark the Change password option to enter a different password.

4. Click Save. The Additional Tasks window reappears.

## Managing user authentication

Use the Manage user authentication process to change the authentication type for this Dynamics GP instance. If there are accounts assigned for the current authentication type, the assigned accounts will be removed when the authentication type is changed. You cannot change the authentication type if there is an active workflow or a workflow that is currently pending user action.

During the initial Dynamics GP installation, you selected an authentication type. If you upgraded to this version of Dynamics GP from a previous release, the authentication type was set to Windows Account automatically.

To manage the user authentication

1. Select the manage user authentication option in the Additional Tasks window and click Process.

2. In the Manage User Authentication window, select the Authentication Type drop down and select the authentication type.

3. If you have selected Organizational Account, provide the required configuration information for using Organizational Accounts.

Provide the Microsoft Entra domain name for the user accounts. An example is *contoso.onmicrosoft.com*. Provide the name of the SQL Server instance where the web components database is stored and the name of the web components database.

4. Click OK. The Additional Tasks window reappears.
