# System Administration Guide

The System Administrator's Guide is designed to give an experienced computer
user the information that is needed to maintain Microsoft Dynamics GP.

This manual includes detailed information about maintaining data, optimizing
databases, setting up printers, using the Distributed Process Server, and
solving problems that may arise within Microsoft Dynamics GP.

Some features described in the documentation are optional and can be purchased
through your Microsoft Dynamics GP partner.

To view information about the release of Microsoft Dynamics GP that you're using
and which modules or features you are registered to use, choose Help \>\> About
Microsoft Dynamics GP.

The manual is divided into the following parts:

- *Part 1, Customization*, describes how to set up the system password,
    routine checklists, and default printers in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- *Part 2, Routine maintenance*, describes how data is stored, and explains
    how to help protect and maintain your data.

- *Part 3, Distributed Process Server*, describes how to set up and use the
    remote processing features available with Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- *Part 4, Technical reference*, contains information about integrating
    products, launch files, and defaults files.

- *Part 5, Troubleshooting*, explains how to detect data that needs
    maintenance, and repair the data if necessary. It also contains solutions to
    commonly encountered problems with location translations, launch files,
    process servers, and defaults files.

## Part 1: Customization

This part of the documentation describes how to customize the Microsoft Dynamics
GP system to fit your needs. The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 1, "System customization,"* describes how to modify the routine
    checklists, and default printers in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- *Chapter 2, "Printers,"* describes how to use named printers and how to set
    up default printers for an entire system, for each user, or for each
    company.

### Chapter 1: System customization

Microsoft Dynamics GP allows you to tailor routine checklists, and report
printing to your business's specific needs. This enables you to provide
different access levels to Microsoft Dynamics GP and to work more
efficiently.

The customization information contains the following sections:

- *Modifying a routine checklist*

- *Printing reports without dialog boxes*

#### Modifying a routine checklist

Microsoft Dynamics GP allows you to modify existing checklists and to create
customized checklists of routines for each series. You can specify the
frequency with which each set of routines should be completed: daily, on
payday, at the end of a period, month, quarter, fiscal year or calendar
year, during setup, or at a frequency you choose. In addition, you can
record macros and add them to your checklists.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 5.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> While you can open the appropriate windows to perform the tasks from a checklist window, the actual tasks aren't performed automatically.

The checklist of routines acts as a sort of audit trail, recording the time
each task was selected, the date the task was completed and the user ID of
the user who completed the procedure.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 6.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> A checklist registers the ID of the user who performed a routine and when it was completed only if a user performed it by selecting the routine in the checklists window and choosing Open. The checklist will not be updated if a user performs a routine by opening a window any other way, such as from a menu.

**To modify a routine checklist:**

1. Be sure that you are logged in to the correct company.

2. Open a checklists window.

(Administration \>\> Routines \>\> Company \>\> Checklists)

<!--- ![A screenshot ](media/41e0028d957325a5ec9ead101e554179.jpg) --->

1. Select a module within the series, if necessary.

2. Select the frequency with which you want the routine to be completed.

3. Choose whether to add, modify, or delete a checklist. If you want to modify
    or delete a checklist item, you must first select it in the checklist
    window.

4. If you are adding a routine, name the routine in the Add-Modify window.

<!---![A Screenshot](media/a70a053047b2ea7d171a61dc3d65cc1c.jpg)--->


1. In the Type list, specify the type of routine to add.

    - Microsoft Dynamics GP window

    - External task

    - Microsoft Dynamics GP macro

2. Choose the Application lookup button to view the options for the type of     routine you selected in step 7.

The following table presents subsequent required actions for each option:

| **Option**                   | **Action**                                                                                                                                                                                       |

1. Choose OK to add the item to the list of routines.

<!---![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)--->

> [!NOTE]
> Choosing the Revert button in a list of routines removes all the additions and modifications you've made, and resets the list of routines to the Microsoft Dynamics GP default settings. The original settings are denoted by a 0/0/0 in the Date Done column and 12: 00: 00 AM in the Time column. Original settings don't have an entry in the User ID column.

#### Printing reports without dialog boxes

For reports you print to a printer, you can prevent the print dialog boxes
from appearing; one copy of the report will be printed to the designated
printer. If you print numerous reports to a printer at once, or if you post
and print posting journals overnight, you may want to prevent the print
dialog box from appearing. The dialog box is shown in the following
illustration.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 9.jpg)

<!---![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)--->

> [!NOTE]
> You need to complete these steps on each computer where you don't want print dialog boxes to appear.

**To print reports without dialog boxes:**

1. Open the Named Printer Options window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers \>\> Machine ID
link)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide10.jpg)

1. Mark the Do Not Display System Print Dialog option.

2. Choose OK.

If you haven't set up the default printer, the Setup Named Printers window
will open along with the Microsoft Windows Print Setup window. The default
printer is used if there is not a printer specified for the report or
company. See *[Setting up printers for a workstation](#setting-up-printers-for-a-workstation) for more
information about setting up the default printer.

### Chapter 2: Printers

Microsoft Dynamics GP uses named printers to automatically print specific
reports to assigned printers. You also can set up default printers for an
entire system, for each user, or for each company.

This information includes the following sections:

- *Printer options*

- *Printer classes*

- *How printers are selected*

- *Reports you can use with named printers*

- *Setting up named printers*

- *Setting up printers for a workstation*

- *Adding a printer ID*

- *Assigning named printers to reports*

- *Importing printer settings*

- *Setting up a template user for named printers*

- *Changing printer ID settings*

- *Changing machine ID settings*

- *Changing printer assignments*

- *Removing printer assignments*

#### Printer options

You have many choices when you print reports or documents in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- You can select the printer each time you print a report.

- You can specify a default printer for all reports printed from a particular
    workstation.

- You can specify certain printers for certain types of reports or forms. For
    example, you may have one printer that's only used for printing checks.

To get started, you first need to set up your printers and give them names.
Then, you'll assign those printers to the particular functions they'll be
used for.

#### Printer classes

You can use printer classes when you print reports or documents in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

**System** Printer IDs assigned to the System class will be available to all
combinations of users and companies.

**User** Printer IDs assigned to the User printer class will be available to
only a single user for all companies.

**Company** Printer IDs assigned to a Company class will be available to all
users for a single company.

**User & Company** Printer IDs assigned to a User & Company class will be
available only to a specified user and company combination.

#### How printers are selected

The named printers settings will be used only if you have chosen to print the
report to a printer.

- For posting journals, you must have either the Ask Each Time or Send to
    Printer option marked for the report in the Posting Setup window.

- For analysis and activity reports that use a report option, one of the
    destinations must be Printer for the report option.

For example, if you have marked only the Send to Screen option for a posting
journal in the Posting Setup window, even though you have selected a printer in
the Assign Named Printers window for the posting journal, the report won't be
sent to the printer, only to the screen.

In general, the printer class will be checked first. If the printer class is
User, Company, or User & Company, the printer class will be used to determine
the printer used. If no assigned printer is found, the company default printer
is checked, and then the system default printer is checked.

#### Reports you can use with named printers

You can assign printers to the following documents and reports:

| **Module**             | **Report or document**                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| General Ledger         | Cross reference reports               |

| Payroll                   | 1099-R and 1096 forms Custom reports Direct Deposit Statement of Earnings Paychecks and Direct Deposit forms W-2 and W-3 forms Wages and hours reports |

#### Setting up named printers

The first time you use named printers on each workstation, the Named Printer
Options window will open and you must set up a machine ID for the
workstation. Once you do this, the Assign Named Printers window will open
when you choose Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers.

After the setup process is complete and you choose to print a report,
Microsoft

Dynamics GP will print reports to the named printers assigned to specific
tasks.

#### Setting up printers for a workstation

Use the Named Printer Options window to set up a machine ID for each
workstation that will be used to print reports or documents. After setting
up named printers, Microsoft Dynamics GP will always print to the named
printers default printer, not the workstation's default printer.

**To set up printers for a workstation:**

1. Open the Named Printer Options window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 9.jpg)

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->



*If you have already set up printers for a workstation, choose
Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers \>\> Machine ID
link to open the Named Printer Options window.*

1. Enter a machine ID. The default ID is the workstation's network or computer
    name.

The machine ID is used to associate the named printer with the actual
workstation, not the user.

1. You can choose not to display the print dialog box when printing reports. If
    you print numerous reports to a printer at once, or if you post and print
    posting journals overnight, you may want to prevent the print dialog box
    from appearing.

2. Choose OK in the Named Printer Options window. You will receive an alert
    message saying you need to select the default printer.

3. Choose OK. The Setup Named Printers window will open along with the Print
    Setup window from Windows.

In the Print Setup window, the default printer from Windows will be the
initial selection. You can change the printer and its settings. Choose OK to
save your changes and close the Print Setup window.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 12.jpg)

1. In the Setup Named Printers window, DEFAULT is entered as the printer ID and
    the printer name automatically comes from the Print Setup window in Step 5.
    You can change the printer and enter extra descriptive information for the
    printer.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 13.jpg)

1. Select a printer class.

<!--![](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*For the default printer, the printer class must be System.*

1. Choose Save. You can continue to set up the printer IDs you will need for
    this workstation.

#### Adding a printer ID

You can create an unlimited number of printer IDs. Also, you can create
multiple printer IDs with different settings for the same printer. For
example, you can create two printer IDs, one with landscape orientation and
one with portrait orientation, for the same printer.

**To add a printer ID:**

1. Open the Assign Named Printers window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 15.jpg)

1. Choose Setup to open the Setup Named Printers window.

2. Enter a printer ID and select one of the four printer classes:

**System** Printer IDs assigned to the System class will be available to all
combinations of users and companies.

**User** Printer IDs assigned to the User printer class will be available to
only a single user for all companies.

**Company** Printer IDs assigned to a Company class will be available to all
users for a single company.

**User & Company** Printer IDs assigned to a User & Company class will be
available only to a specified user and company combination.

1. If you select User, Company, or User & Company as the printer class, enter a
    user ID, company name, or both.

2. Select the printer and settings. You also can enter an extra description for
    the printer.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->



*If you have the capability to send and receive faxes from a workstation,
you can set up the fax machine as a printer in Windows. This printer can be
given a Printer ID and used as a named printer.*

1. Choose Save and close the window.

#### Assigning named printers to reports

Once you have set up the printer IDs for the workstation, you can assign a
printer to specific reports.

If you're using advanced picking, you can specify a default printer for a
site. This is necessary only if you want a different printer to be used for
a specific site.

You must specify a default printer for the System task series. You also can
specify a default printer for a company by selecting Company as the task
series and selecting the company name. Specifying a default printer for a
company is optional and is necessary only if you want a different default
printer to be used for a specific user, company, or user and company
combination. When choosing the default printer for a company, you can't use
Any Printer or Manual Selection for the printer class.

The printer settings will be used only if you print the report to a printer.
See *[How printers are selected](#how-printers-are-selected) for more information.

**To assign named printers to reports:**

1. Open the Assign Named Printers window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers)

The user ID and company name you used to log in to Microsoft Dynamics GP
appear in the user ID and company name fields, but you can change them.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 15.jpg)

> [!TIP]
> You also can assign a printer by choosing the Assign button in the Setup
Named Printers window.

1. Select a Sales task series.

Printers set up under each task series (such as Sales and Purchasing) will
be used for all printing for that series.

Printers set up under the Processes series will be used only by the process
server. If you want to send reports to the process server, you must select
Process as the task series. You should not leave the printer ID field empty
or use the Manual Selection printer class when using the process server. For
information about setting up the Distributed Process Server, see [Chapter
10, "Remote processing setup](#chapter-10-remote-processing-setup).

1. Select a task description.

If you select one of the following descriptions, continue with step 4.
Otherwise, continue with step 6.

- Sales Orders - Bulk Picking Ticket

- Sales Orders - Packing Slips Printer - Blank

- Sales Orders - Packing Slips Printer - Short

- Sales Orders - Packing Slips Printer - Long

- Sales Orders - Picking Tickets Printer - Blank

- Sales Orders - Picking Tickets Printer - Short

- Sales Orders - Picking Tickets Printer - Long

1. Choose the Task Description expansion button to open the Assign Pick/Pack
    Named Printers window.

2. Enter or select a site ID, a printer class, and a printer ID. Choose OK.

3. Select a printer class.

**System** If you selected the printer class of System and have assigned
printer IDs to this printer class, the Named Printers window will open. Only
the printers assigned to the printer class will be listed.

**User, Company, or User & Company** If you select the printer class of
User, Company, or User & Company, the user ID and company name in this
window must match the user ID and company name assigned to the printer
class, or the printer ID won't be listed.

If you select the printer class of System, User, Company, or User & Company
but don't select a printer ID, you can choose from any available printer ID
in that class set up on the workstation when you print the report.

**Any Printer ID** If you select Any Printer ID for the printer class, you
can choose from any available printer ID set up on the workstation when you
print the report. You can't assign a printer to a task with the Any Printer
ID class.

**Manual Selection** If you select Manual Selection for the printer class,
you won't assign a printer to the task. Instead, when you print the report,
the Print Setup window will open and you can choose the printer and printer
settings.

**None** This is the default entry, indicating that you haven't selected a
default printer for the task.

1. Select a printer from the list and choose Select.

2. Continue selecting printers for each task in the series.

3. Choose OK close the window. The printer assignments are saved as they are
    entered.

#### Importing printer settings

You can import the printer settings from one workstation to another. This
allows you to set up a machine ID and printer settings on one workstation
and duplicate the printer settings on other workstations in your system.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 19.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Because printer settings are not always compatible between different Windows platforms, we recommend that you import settings only from workstations that are running the same version of Windows and have identical printer configurations in the control panel settings.

**To import printer settings:**

1. Open the Assign Named Printers window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers)

1. Choose Setup to open the Setup Named Printers window, then choose Advanced
    to open the Setup Named Printers – Advanced window.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 19.jpg)

1. Enter the machine ID of the workstation you want to import the settings from
    and choose Import.

2. Choose OK to close the window.

You also can remove the printer for a machine ID. This should be done only
if the workstation is removed from the system.

If the workstation is renamed on the network, you can change the machine ID
in the Named Printer Options window and all the existing settings will be
moved to the new machine ID. You don't need to remove the old machine ID.

#### Setting up a template user for named printers

If you have many users that print from the same workstation, such as in a
Terminal Server system, you can set up a template user. A template is used
only for the User and User & Company class printer settings. If a user ID
does not have a printer ID assigned, the printer ID from the associated
template user ID will be used.

Once you create a template user and set up the named printers for that one
user, you can link other users to the template. You also can have multiple
templates, so if two sites of 20 people each use a single Terminal Server,
instead of setting up 40 users, you need to set up only two.

The template user can be an additional user created only for named printers.
This user does not require access to any companies. You also can select an
existing user as the template user.

If you link a user to a template user, you can override the printer
assignments for the template user by assigning a different printer to the
user for a specific task. For example, User A is linked to the template user
and will use the printers and settings of the template user except for Sales
Order Processing invoices. A different printer is assigned to this task for
User A.

**To set up a template user for named printers:**

1. Open the Assign Named Printers window.

   (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Named Printers)

1. Choose Setup to open the Setup Named Printers window, then choose Advanced
    to open the Setup Named Printers – Advanced window.

1. Select a user ID to use as the template. A list of all other users will
    appear in the bottom of the window.

1. Mark the user IDs that will be linked to this template.

   Visual cues help you distinguish the different types of users. The following
icons are used.

   | **Icon**                                              | **Description**                           |
   |-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | <!--:::image type="icon" source="./media/image12.jpg":::--> | The user ID is linked to a template user. |
   | <!--:::image type="icon" source="./media/image10.jpg":::--> | The user ID is a template user.           |

1. Choose OK to save your changes.

Once a user ID has been assigned as the template user or has been linked to
a template user, its role can't be changed unless the link is removed. To
remove a link, unmark the user ID in the Setup Named Printers – Advanced
window.

## Part 2: Routine maintenance

Completing the recommended maintenance procedures will help keep Microsoft
Dynamics GP running smoothly. Making regular backups will help you to
recover your data if an unexpected event occurs. You can use the Manage
Automated Client Updates window to set up updates to be installed
automatically on your client computers.

The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 3, "Microsoft Dynamics GP tables,"* provides the basics of data
    storage in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- *Chapter 4, "Maintenance procedures,"* describes the steps you should take
    to protect and maintain your data.

- *Chapter 5, "Database Maintenance Utility,"* provides information about the
    Database Maintenance Utility for Microsoft Dynamics GP so you can reload
    database objects such as stored procedures and triggers.

- *Chapter 6, "Companies offline,"* provides information about taking one or
    multiple companies offline for maintenance or administrative tasks such as a
    year-end close or an update.

- *Chapter 7, "Client updates,"* describes client updates and how to set up
    updates to be installed automatically on client computers.

### Chapter 3: Microsoft Dynamics GP tables

Review the following information about Microsoft Dynamics GP tables before
attempting to use table maintenance procedures. This information will
familiarize you with the basics of data storage in Microsoft Dynamics GP.
Understanding the basic concepts associated with Microsoft Dynamics GP
tables will give you better insight into how data is stored and how it flows
through Microsoft Dynamics GP.

The tables information contains the following sections:

- *How records are stored in Microsoft Dynamics GP tables*

- *Table groups and tables*

- *Table names*

- *Main table types*

- *Subtable types*

- *Passive record locking*

- *Effects of denying table access*

#### How records are stored in Microsoft Dynamics GP tables

As you enter transactions, accounts, and customer information in Microsoft
Dynamics GP, you'll make entries or selections for many individual fields.
These fields represent the smallest unit of information stored by Microsoft
Dynamics GP.

All the fields that describe a transaction, account, or customer make up a
**record**. Similar records are stored together in a **table**.

For example, assume you have a new customer, Blue Yonder Airlines. You'll
enter a customer ID, the company name, the city where the company is
located, the phone number, and other facts about the company and your
business relationship. Each of these facts is entered in a field, and
together these fields make up the Blue Yonder Airlines customer record. All
your customer records are stored together in a table group called the
Receivables Customer Master Files. If you were entering a General Ledger
transaction, that information would be stored in the Transaction Work table.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 22.jpg)

Just as windows you use to make entries (input) are linked to a particular
table, the information displayed on reports and documents you'll print
(output) is drawn from specific tables.

#### Table groups and tables

Tables are the basis of Microsoft Dynamics GP; they contain your data.
Typically, two or more tables that are used to store related information are
combined to make up a table group, also called a logical table.

For example, the General Ledger Transaction Work table is a table group, made up
of four tables: Transaction Work, Transaction Amounts Work, Transaction Clearing
Amounts Work, and Audit Trail Code Temporary. General information about each
transaction, such as the audit trail code and date is stored in the Transaction
Work table, and transaction amounts are stored in the Transaction Amounts Work
or Transaction Clearing Amounts Work table, depending on whether you've entered
a standard transaction or a clearing transaction.

<!--![A screenshot ](media/708ea670a694e9c158021345c5733c0f.gif)-->

Note that the Transaction Work table group contains a Transaction Work table.
Table groups typically include a table with the same name. In some cases, this
may be the only table in the table group. In System Manager, for example, almost
every table group contains only one table.

#### Table names

Each Microsoft Dynamics GP table has three names: a technical name, a display
name, and a physical name. The **technical name** is used by the software and
will appear instead of a display name in some Microsoft Dynamics GP alert
messages. The **physical name** is the name that will appear for the table when
you view it using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The **display name**
is the name that will appear in most alert messages and is the most commonly
used name for a given table.

You can review the physical, technical, and display names of each table by
choosing Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions \>\>
Tables to display the Table Descriptions window. Refer to your Resource
Description online documentation for detailed steps that can help you view
technical table and field information using the resource description windows.

Tables in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system are divided into different categories
based on how they're used by Microsoft Dynamics GP and the information each
stores. The purpose of each table can be determined by its name. Technical table
names typically are composed of a two-character module abbreviation (such as GL
for General Ledger), followed by a descriptive term for the main contents of the
table, plus a 3- or 4-character main table type abbreviation (such as HIST for a
history table). When appropriate, a subtable type abbreviation or description is
used to further define the contents of the table.

The following describes of some of the naming conventions used in the
Microsoft Dynamics GP system.

| **Main table type** | **Physical name abbreviation** | **Technical name abbreviation** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Master              | 000 – 099                      | MSTR                            |
| Work                | 100 – 199                      | WORK                            |
| Open                | 200 – 299                      | OPEN                            |
| History             | 300 – 399                      | HIST                            |
| Setup               | 400 – 499                      | SETP                            |
| Temp                | 500 – 599                      | TEMP                            |
| Relation            | 600 – 699                      | REL                             |
| Report Options      | 700 – 799                      | ROPT                            |

The following table shows examples of table names in the Microsoft Dynamics
GP system.

| **Main table type** | **Physical name example** | **Technical name example** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Master              | GL00100                   | GL_Account_MSTR            |
| Work                | GL10000                   | GL_TRX_HDR_WORK            |
| Open                | GL20000                   | GL_YTD_TRX_OPEN            |
| History             | GL30001                   | GL_Account_SUM\_ HIST      |
| Setup               | SY40300                   | SY_Class_Normal_SETP       |
| Temp                | GL50900                   | GL_Year_End_Closing_TEMP   |
| Relation            | SY60100                   | SY_User_Company_Access_REL |
| Report Options      | SY70200                   | SY_Group_Names_ROPT        |

#### Main table types

Most of the information in Microsoft Dynamics GP is stored in one of the
following types of tables. Knowing which type of table contains each type of
information will help you find the data you need.

**Setup tables** These tables contain all the default settings and module
options you've specified in the setup windows for each series.

**Master tables** These tables contain all the permanent data about your
business, such as information about accounts, vendors, customers, and items.

**Work tables** Work tables contain unposted batches of transactions entered
using windows that can be opened using the Transactions menu on the tool
bar. These transactions are temporary and can be changed or deleted until
they are posted to an open table.

**Open tables** Depending on the module, these tables may contain posted
transactions for the open year. For example, the open tables in General
Ledger contain posted transactions for any open year while the open tables
in Payables Management contain unpaid posted transactions. How information
in the open tables is moved to the history tables depends on the module as
well. Transactions are moved to history when an open year is closed in
General Ledger or the transactions are fully applied in Payables Management.

**History tables** These tables contain paid transactions, or transactions from
a previous year.

#### Subtable types

Subtable types are used to further define the main table types. When used in
conjunction with one of the main table type abbreviations, a subtable type
indicates the relationship a table has with another table in its table group.
The subtable type abbreviation will always appear before the main type
abbreviation and is used in instances where several tables are grouped to form a
table group. For instance, the General Ledger Transaction Work table group is
made up of three work tables, but each one has a specific function that's
indicated by its subtable type:

| **Table group**        | **Tables**                                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction Work table | Transaction Clearing Amounts Work GL_TRX\_**Clearing**\_WORK |
|                        | Transaction Work GL_TRX\_**HDR**\_WORK                       |
|                        | Transaction Amounts Work GL_TRX\_**LINE**\_WORK              |

The following table lists some of the more common subtable types used for
tables. In many instances, a descriptive term is used rather than an
abbreviation, such as "Clearing" for the GL_TRX_Clearing_WORK table:

| **Subtable type** | **Abbreviation** |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Table Header      | FHDR             |
| Batch Header      | BHDR             |
| Serial Number     | SERL             |
| Header            | HDR              |
| Line Item         | LINE             |
| Tax               | HTAX             |
| Line Tax          | LTAX             |
| Address           | ADDR             |

Use the help to learn more about the type of table information that's available
in the resource description windows. Then follow the step-by-step instructions
in the help to find the technical table information you need.

#### Passive record locking

There are a few instances when a single person must have exclusive access to a
particular data table, or collection of similar records. Typically this is true
only if the individual is performing a table maintenance procedure, such as
clearing data.

Microsoft Dynamics GP manages records using optimistic concurrency control or
passive record locking. Optimistic concurrency control enables many people to
work with the same records—customer accounts, for example—without competing for
records. Coworkers update records one field at a time, so two or more people can
change a record simultaneously if they're changing different fields. However, if
they are changing the same field, the second person to save the record receives
a message saying that changes have been made to the record since he or she
accessed it. When the second person chooses OK in response to the alert message,
the window is updated with the first person's changes.

#### Effects of denying table access

Some types of information may be available on several reports. For example,
the information in the Unit Accounts List also is available in the Accounts
List. If you want to restrict access to certain types of information, be
sure to restrict access to all of the reports that include that information.

**Reports**

If you set up security for a table, reports that use that table for printing
will be affected by the security option. For example, if you are denied
access to the Account Master table, you can still use financial cards and
post transactions, but a message indicating a table security error will
appear if you attempt to print a report using the Account Master table. If
you don't have access to a table, you won't be able to use other
applications to write data to that table.

**SmartList**

Removing access to tables may mean some SmartList objects won't be
displayed. Multiple SmartList objects may be affected by removing access to
a single logical table. In some cases, multiple logical tables affect a
SmartList object and removing access to any one of the logical tables will
remove access to the object.

If the SmartList window is already open and access is removed from a table,
the changes will not appear until the SmartList window is closed and
reopened.

### Chapter 4: Maintenance procedures

The Microsoft Dynamics GP system is designed to help ensure maximum accuracy
and integrity of your accounting data. Hardware failures, power surges, and
other problems might require maintenance procedures to be perform on data
tables.

It's necessary to take measures to protect your data. Regularly back up your
accounting data and perform table maintenance to help minimize risk of data
loss.

Maintenance information is divided into the following sections:

- *Backups overview*

- *Database backup procedures*

- *When to perform a database backup*

- *Backing up your data*

- *Updating statistics*

- *Recompiling stored procedures*

If you discover a problem with your accounting data tables during
maintenance or if a problem persists after performing maintenance, see
*Chapter 16, "Data recovery,"* for information on resolving the problem.

#### Backups overview

A backup is a copy of your SQL Server databases on another medium separate
from the hard disk where you have the original databases. You can help
prevent loss of your company's data by making frequent, regular backups.
Having a good set of backups is like having insurance—without it, you risk
losing your information and spending a great deal of time reentering it.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft Dynamics GP installed on a server, you must back up your data on the server.

In addition to making backups of your tables, you should back up your
transactions-related information by printing and storing posting journals and
reports, or by sending them to a file. Then, if you need to restore a
backup, finding and reentering the information that's been entered since the
backup will be much simpler and quicker. Also, keep all of the reports that
you usually use, either as printed copies or in files. Detailed reports from
open tables, tables containing current posted transactions, and history
tables contain the most complete information.

To help ensure that you always have current backups, you should design and
follow a formal backup schedule or create a schedule for automated backups.

Be sure to incorporate a rotation plan so that you aren't copying over the
same backup every day. This will eliminate the loss of data if an issue
isn't detected for several days. Backups should be clearly labeled so that
you can distinguish one set from another. We also recommend that you label
daily, weekly, and monthly backups separately so that they don't become
mixed together.

#### Database backup procedures

You should back up databases and transaction logs frequently, and you should
save the backups.

The frequency and type of backups you do depends on two factors: the acceptable
amount of work that can be lost due to media or other failure, and the volume of
transactions that occur on the SQL server. For systems that have little update
activity and that are used primarily for viewing data, weekly database backups
might be sufficient. For high-volume environments, database backups are needed
daily and transaction logs hourly. The strategy chosen should fit your
environment and provide adequate assurance of recovering needed data..

The following is an example of a typical backup schedule:

| **Item**                     | **When to back up** | **Minimum time to keep back up** |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Transaction log              | Hourly              | Two weeks                        |
| Database and Transaction log | Every day           | Two months                       |

The following table lists which resources need to be backed up:

| **Item**                       | **Items to back up**                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forms.dic                      | If your Microsoft Dynamics GP windows have been customized using the Modifier, back up all of your forms dictionaries when you install it, or monthly if you use the Modifier to make additional customizations. |
| Reports.dic                    | If you use Report Writer to modify or create reports, back up all of your reports dictionaries monthly as part of your system backups, or more frequently as changes are made.                                  |
| Microsoft Dynamics GP database | Back up all tables in the database monthly as part of your system backup, or more frequently as changes are made.                                                                                               |
| Each of your company databases | Back up each company database daily. In addition, the documentation for other procedures, such as table maintenance, may prompt you to make a backup as well.                                                   |
| master database                | The master database records all the system-level information for a SQL Server system. You should back this database up if you add databases and users to SQL Server.                                            |
| msdb database                  | This is the database used by SQL Server Agent to store tasks. If you use SQL Server Agent to schedule automatic tasks, back up this database as part of your system backups.                                    |

If database backups are performed online, they should be scheduled for times
when the server is not being heavily updated, because the backups will slow the
server somewhat. In addition, the backups should be performed on a fixed
schedule. By using a fixed schedule, users will always know when the backup is
occurring and can expect a slight delay in performance, or they can plan to do
other non- serverrelated tasks during that time.

#### When to perform a database backup

It is important to back up a database either before or after the following
procedures:

**Creating a database**

Each database should be backed up just after it is created, and on a fixed
schedule thereafter. For example, if you create a database on Monday and
wait until Friday afternoon to back it up, you risk losing a whole week's
work if there is a media failure on Friday morning.

**Performing an operation that isn't logged**

You must back up a database any time you perform an operation that is not
logged. If you don't, the transaction log backup isn't useful.

**Database maintenance procedures**

We recommend that you back up any affected tables before and after
performing any database maintenance procedure that could possibly change
your data. This includes Database Console Commands (DBCC) as well as the
Update Statistics and Recompile functions within Microsoft Dynamics GP.
Power fluctuation or hardware failure can cause detrimental damage to your
data when performing these tasks.

**Data recovery procedures**

Back up all affected tables before and after performing data recovery
procedures in case of power fluctuations or hardware failure during these
processes. Back up data before restoring a backup in case you need to refer
to it later or in case your current backup is damaged.

**Updating or installing additional products**

Back up your entire Microsoft Dynamics GP system before and after updating
to a new version of Microsoft Dynamics GP or installing additional products.
Power fluctuations and hardware failure can cause detrimental damage during
an update. If your data is damaged before you update your system, you'll
need to restore the backup to fix any damage.

#### Backing up your data

Use the Back Up Company window to back up data. You can store the backup
file on your local hard drive, local network, or Microsoft Azure storage.
Complete this procedure for each company you're backing up and for the
system database. You also can use SQL Server Management Studio to back up
data.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->



*Only a system administrator can open the Back Up Company window to make
backups. The Back Up Company window is only available when using a Microsoft
Dynamics GP installation on the SQL Server.*

**To back up your data:**

1. Open the Back Up Company window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> Backup)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 25.jpg)

1. Select the company you want to back up, or System Database to back up system
    data.

2. Select the storage location. To use the Use Microsoft Azure storage option,
    you must be using SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1 Cumulative Update 2 or
    later.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to create a storage account and container if you want to use a Microsoft Azure storage location.

1. The path and file name of the backup file are displayed. You can modify the
    path and file name as needed.

2. If you have marked the Use Microsoft Azure storage option, enter the access
    key, URL to container, and the file name. Then, choose Verify Account to
    verify a connection to the Microsoft Azure storage location.

3. Click OK to make the backup. The window will be closed and a message will
    appear when the backup is complete.

#### Updating statistics

Use the SQL Maintenance window to reconfigure your data table keys for better
performance.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 28.jpg)

*Microsoft SQL Server updates statistics automatically. For more
information, see your SQL Server documentation.*

SQL Server and SQL Server Express uses statistics about key values to select
which index or indexes to use to process queries. If there is a significant
change in the key values in an index, you should update statistics for that
index. You should also update statistics if a great deal of data in an indexed
column has been added, changed, or removed.

A system administrator can update statistics if there are performance issues.

**To update statistics:**

1. Open the SQL Maintenance window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> SQL)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 28.jpg)

1. Select a database and at least one table, and mark the Update Statistics
    option.

2. Choose Process.

#### Recompiling stored procedures

Use the SQL Maintenance window to adapt stored procedures to data tables
with significant increases or decreases in data, resulting in better
performance.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft SQL Server recompiles stored procedures automatically. For more information, see your SQL Server documentation.

As you make changes to your database that affect statistics, your stored
procedures may lose efficiency. By recompiling the stored procedures that
act on a table, you can optimize queries. This optimization happens
automatically in some cases. However, if a new index is added, the stored
procedure isn't automatically optimized.

You can recompile stored procedures if you are having performance issues.

**To recompile stored procedures:**

1. Open the SQL Maintenance window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> SQL)

1. Select a database and at least one table, and mark the Recompile option.

2. Choose Process.

### Chapter 5: Database Maintenance Utility

You can use the Database Maintenance Utility for Microsoft Dynamics GP to
reload database objects such as stored procedures and triggers.

This chapter contains the following sections.

- *Database Maintenance Utility overview*

- *Reloading database objects*

#### Database Maintenance Utility overview

You might be directed by the Microsoft Dynamics GP technical support team to
reload database objects if, for example, a stored procedure was deleted. You
can use the Database Maintenance Utility to reload database objects for
selected databases and components.

A database contains tables that store data. A database also contains other
database objects such as stored procedures, functions, views, and database
triggers. You can use the Database Maintenance Utility to reload the
following database objects.

| **Database object** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View                | A view is a virtual table whose contents are defined by a query. Data for a view comes from other tables in the database.                                           |
| Trigger             | A database trigger is a special class of SQL stored procedure that executes automatically when an update, insert, or delete statement is issued for a table or view. |
| Stored procedure    | A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that are compiled and stored as a database object.                                                                  |
| Function            | A function is a command that returns a value.                                                                                                                       |

The process of reloading database objects deletes and reloads the objects in
the selected databases and components. Any customizations you've made to
objects, including Pre and Post procedures in eConnect for Microsoft
Dynamics GP, are removed, as well. Before you reload database objects, you
should make a backup of the system (DYNAMICS) and company databases. After
reloading the database objects, you should reload your customizations.

#### Reloading database objects

Use the Database Maintenance Utility to reload database objects for selected
databases and components. You might need to reload your database objects if,
for example, a stored procedure is deleted.

If you are reloading stored procedures for eConnect for Microsoft Dynamics
GP, you must select Microsoft Dynamics GP and Project Accounting, if
installed, as the products to reload database objects for.

**To reload database objects:**

1. Make a backup of the system (DYNAMICS) and company databases.

2. Open the Microsoft Dynamics GP Database Maintenance Utility window.

(Choose Start \>\> All Programs \>\> Microsoft Dynamics \>\> GP \>\>
Database Maintenance.)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 30.jpg)

*You must be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role and be the only user
connected to the database to reload database objects. For more information
about the sysadmin fixed server role, refer to Microsoft SQL Server Books
Online.*

1. Enter or select the server you want to access and select the security mode
    used to authenticate your server connection.

If you select the SQL Authentication option, enter your login ID and
password.

1. Choose Next.

2. In the Select Database window, mark the databases to reload database objects
    for, and then choose Next.

3. In the Select Products window, mark the component or components to reload
    database objects for, and then choose Next.

4. In the Select Database Objects window, mark the database objects to reload,
    and then choose Next.

5. In the Confirmation window, review the selections you've made, and then
    choose Next to reload objects.

6. The Progress window appears, where you can view the status of the database
    objects.

7. In the Finish window, review the results of reloading database objects. If
    there are no errors, close the utility.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->



*After restoring database objects, you will need to reload any database
object customizations, such as Pre and Post procedures in eConnect.*

If there are errors, such as the connection to SQL Server failed, you should
verify that you are the only user connected to the database and select to
reload the objects for that database again.

### Chapter 6: Companies offline

You can take one or more companies offline for maintenance or administrative
tasks, such as a year-end close or an update. As an administrator, you can
select the companies that you want to take offline and select the user that
will still have access to an offline company. You also can view how many
users are currently logged in to the companies that you want to take offline
and send a message to those users while they are using Microsoft Dynamics
GP.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Assign a user for offline company access*

- *Take a company offline*

- *Sending a message to users currently logged in to an offline company*

#### Assign a user for offline company access

When a company is offline, you might want a user other than the system
administrator to be able to log in to the company. You can use the Company
Setup window to assign a user who can still log in to the company while it's
offline.

**To assign a user for offline company access:**

1. Open the Company Setup window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> Company \>\> Company)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 31.jpg)

1. In the User with offline access field, select the user that will have access
    to the company when it offline.

2. Choose OK to save your changes and close the Company Setup window.

#### Take a company offline

You can take one or more companies offline for maintenance or administrative
tasks, such as a year-end close or an update. You can use the Take Company
Offline for Maintenance window to select the companies that you want to take
offline. You also can send a default or custom message to the users who
attempt to log in to a company while it's offline.

When a company has been taken offline, the current users can continue working in
the company. Once those users log out of the company, they will not be able to
log back in to the company unless they have offline access.

You must be an administrator to take a company offline.

**To take a company offline:**

1. Open the Take Company Offline for Maintenance window.

(Administration \>\> Utilities \>\> System \>\> Take Company Offline)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 32.jpg)

1. Select a company and choose Insert to move it to the Offline Companies list.
    Choose Insert All to move all companies to the Offline Companies list.

To remove a company from the Offline Companies list, select it and choose
Remove. Choose Remove All to remove all companies.

1. Click the Current Users link to open the User Activity window where you can
    view the users that are currently logged in to the companies that you want
    to take offline.

2. Select to send a default or custom message when users attempt to log in to
    the offline companies.

If you select the Custom option, enter the message that you want to send.
For example, the message might state that the Fabrikam company is offline
until 2 P.M. because of a year-end close.

1. Choose OK to take the companies offline.

If there are uses logged in to the companies that are being taken offline, a
message appears asking whether you want to send those users a message using
the Send Message window. If you decide to send a message, the Send Message
window appears. See *Sending a message to users currently logged in to an
offline company* for more information.

#### Sending a message to users currently logged in to an offline company

You can use the Send Message window to send messages to users. You can select the users and type of message you would like to send. For example, you can send a task with reminder message of an upcoming event to all users or a "please log out of Microsoft Dynamics GP" notification message to users currently logged into a company that has been taken offline.

You must be an administrator to send messages to your users about an offline
company.

**To send a message to users currently logged in to an offline company:**

1. Open the Send Message window.

(Administration \>\> Utilities \>\> System \>\> Send Users Message)

![A screenshot](media/sys admin guide 33.jpg)

1. Select the users you want to send a message to.

2. Select how to send the message. You can send a notification message, a task
    with a reminder, or both.

3. Enter the message that you want to send. For example, the message might
    state that the Fabrikam company is offline while a year-end close is being
    run. This message is used for the notification message and the task.

4. Choose Send to send the message.

### Chapter 7: Client updates

You can install updates on your client computers automatically by using the
Manage Automated Client Updates window. You must be an administrator to use
this window.

Client update information is divided into the following sections:

- *Client update overview*

- *Setting up an update to install on client computers*

- *Troubleshooting logging in to Microsoft Dynamics GP*

#### Client update overview

When an update is available, you must install the update on one computer
first before installing it on the client computers. An update can be a
Microsoft Dynamics GP service pack or hotfix. An update also can be a .cnk
file created by an independent software vendor or a customization developed
by you or your partner. If an update is a service pack, you must use
Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities to update the database. If the update is a
cnk file, you must start Microsoft Dynamics GP to include code.

If the update should be available to your client computers, you can place
the update in a shared network location that each client computer has access
to. Then, use the Manage Automated Client Updates window to set up the
update to be installed automatically on your client computers. Multiple
updates can be set up and applied to the client computers.

When a user logs in to Microsoft Dynamics GP on a client computer, the
client version information is checked against the version information for
the update. If an update is required, a message will instruct the user to
install the update.

- By choosing Yes, Microsoft Dynamics GP closes and the update process will
    begin. If the update has a .msp file extension, a progress window is
    displayed to show the status of the update. After the update is installed,
    the user can start Microsoft Dynamics GP again.

- By choosing No, the update isn't applied and Microsoft Dynamics GP closes.

You can't use Microsoft Dynamics GP on the client computer until it is
updated.

If an update isn't successfully installed on a client, a log file will be
created that describes errors in the temporary directory for the client. The
log file will use the name of the update file plus a .log extension. For
example, if a service pack is named GP_SP1.msp, the log file will be named
GP_SP1.log.

#### Setting up an update to install on client computers

Use the Manage Automated Client Updates window to set up an update to be
installed automatically on your client computers. Multiple updates can be set up
and applied to client computers. You must be an administrator to use this
window.

Before you set up an update to be installed on client computers, you must apply
the update to your server.

**To set up an update to install on client computers:**

1. Open the Manage Automated Client Updates window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Client Updates)

1. Enter or select the update name.

2. Specify whether the update should be automatically installed on the client
    computers the next time that users log in to Microsoft Dynamics GP.

3. Enter the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to where the update is
    located. The update must be located in a shared network location that each
    client computer has access to.

The file where the update will be installed must have either a .msp or .cnk
extension.

1. Choose Save.

When a user logs in to Microsoft Dynamics GP on a client computer and an
update is required, a message will instruct the user to install the update.
When the user chooses Yes, Microsoft Dynamics GP will close and the update
process will begin.

#### Troubleshooting logging in to Microsoft Dynamics GP

If you have issues logging in to Microsoft Dynamics GP after installing an
update, review the following information.

**Client version information and database setup**

You can't log in to Microsoft Dynamics GP on a client computer if a product
installed on the client computer has different version information than the
server. You can use the GP_LoginErrors.log file in your temporary directory
(typically

C:\\Documents and Settings\\\<user\>\\Local Settings\\Temp\\ GP_LoginErrors.log)
to help resolve the version information issue. The log file will contain the
product name, along with the dictionary and database versions.

To log in to Microsoft Dynamics GP or a company, the product must be installed
on the server. If the database hasn't been set up, you can use Microsoft
Dynamics GP Utilities to complete the database setup. You can use the
GP_LoginErrors.log file in your temporary directory to determine which products
aren't installed.

The following is an example of a GP_LoginErrors.log file.

**GP_LoginErrors.log file**

```Product Name: Human Resources Error: Product is not installed to the database server Product Name: Fixed Assets Database Version 11.00.07 Client Version: 11.00.10```

**Updating Microsoft Dynamics GP with a .cnk file**

An update for Microsoft Dynamics GP can be a .cnk file created by an
independent software vendor or a customization developed by you or your
partner. You can use the Manage Automated Client Updates window to set up a
.cnk file to be installed automatically on your client computers. If the
.cnk file has an .ini file, be sure that there is a carriage return after
the build number in the .ini file. If there isn't a carriage return after
the build number, you may have problems starting or updating Microsoft
Dynamics GP.

## Part 3: Distributed Process Server

Review this part of the documentation for information you need to set up and
use the distributed processing features available with Microsoft Dynamics
GP. The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 8, "Distributed Process Server overview,"* provides information on
    how you can use the process server in your Microsoft Dynamics GP system.

- *Chapter 9, "Process server configuration,"* provides information to help
    you decide which computers you'll use as process servers and how to set up
    your clients, servers, and process servers.

- *Chapter 10, "Remote processing setup,"* describes how to set up remote
    processing.

- *Chapter 11, "Processing and monitoring remote processes,"* describes how to
    start the process server, view tasks being completed, and view logged
    information about remote processes.

### Chapter 8: Distributed Process Server overview

Review this information to become more familiar with what the Distributed
Process Server is and how you can use it in your Microsoft Dynamics GP
system.

The overview information contains the following sections:

- *Understanding process servers*

- *Tasks that can be performed remotely*

- *Using the Distributed Process Server*

- *Load balancing and services*

- *How the Distributed Process Manager handles load balancing*

- *Distributed Process Server files*

- *Distributed Process Manager file*

#### Understanding process servers

Distributed processing is the ability to send processes to other computers
on a network. The Distributed Process Server, or DPS, helps you maximize the
use of network processing power by allowing you to perform certain tasks
that require a large amount of processing power on separate computers. This
reduces the workload of client computers and improves Microsoft Dynamics GP
performance. The client computer used for data entry will be immediately
available to perform other tasks, so you don't have to wait to continue
working while the task is completed, or work more slowly while the task is
completed in the background.

The computers where you'll complete these processes are **process servers**,
computers with high processing power. To take advantage of DPS, it's
important that your process server be a computer with a fast processor and
sufficient RAM, so that tasks can be completed as quickly as possible.

A computer you use as a process server can be a dedicated process server—a
computer used only for remote processing—or a client computer that's also
used for data entry or other tasks. However, to use the power of the process
server as efficiently as possible, we recommend that process servers be
dedicated. You can set up as many process servers as necessary, but may be
limited by your network protocol.

To set up a computer as a process server, install the standard Microsoft
Dynamics GP client applications. (Refer to the Installation Instructions
documentation for more information.) Then you'll specify which computers in
your system are process servers, and which tasks will be completed on those
process servers. Sending a task to a process server is called processing a
task remotely, or **remote processing**.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 34.png)



*Verify the data source name in ODBC. You must use the same data source name
(DSN) in ODBC for all client workstations and process servers in order for
distributed processing to work successfully. (A data source includes the
data a user wants to access and the information needed to get to that data.
An example of a data source is a SQL Server database.) For more information
about setting up ODBC data sources, refer to your Microsoft Dynamics GP
Installation Instructions documentation.*

#### Tasks that can be performed remotely

Tasks within Microsoft Dynamics GP that have a specific start and end point
and that you don't need to continue monitoring by choosing a response in a
dialog box,

or by interacting with the process in other ways, can be processed remotely.
Because you can't interact with the process once it's sent to a process
server, any alert messages that may be generated during the process will be
saved in the Process Server Activity Table.

After you've assigned processes to process servers, each user can then
choose to perform remote processes locally, on the designated process
server, or on a specified service (a group of one or more process servers).

<!--![logo](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

> [!TIP]
> To view all the tasks within Microsoft Dynamics GP that can be processed remotely, see the DPS Setup window (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Process Server).

#### Using the Distributed Process Server

The Dps.exe application is installed on each client computer when you install Microsoft Dynamics GP. If you're using the load balancing feature, be sure the 
Distributed Process Manager application—Dpm.exe—is running, as well. The Dpm.exe application also is installed automatically on each client computer. For more information see [Load balancing and services](#load-balancing-and-services).

Complete the task, such as posting batches or printing reports, as you typically do.

The task will be processed on the process server you've designated during setup. For more information, see [Designating process servers](#designating-process-servers). 

In the User Preferences window, you must select Remote as the Distributed Processes
option to process tasks remotely. You can use the Process Monitor window on
your client computer to view the tasks currently assigned to each process
server. You also can use the Process Monitor window on the process server to
view all processes being completed on that computer.

You don't need to monitor a process while it's being completed. Instead of
displaying any dialog boxes that might appear if you were processing a task
locally, DPS records the information about the message in a file, which you
can view after the task is completed. If an interruption, such as a power
outage, occurs while processing is occurring, DPS will record the error that
occurred in an error log file.

If you want to record the start and end times of remote process activity in
the

Process Server Activity Table, mark the Track Start and End Times option in
the DPS Setup window. If you didn't mark the Track Start and End Times
option, only alert messages will be recorded in the table.

#### Load balancing and services

When several computers on a network are running the process server, maximum
processing power is achieved by evenly distributing the processing load to
those computers. This concept is called **load balancing**.

If you use two or more process servers, you can use a **service** to take
advantage of load balancing. A service is simply a group of process servers.
When load balancing is implemented, you can send remote processes to a
service rather than to a specific server. The Distributed Process Manager
(DPM), the application that manages load balancing, will route the process
to the server with the lightest processing load in the service.

A process server can be assigned to more than one service. (For more
information, see *Creating a service* on page 57.) This allows you to direct
more processes to the most powerful computers running the process server.
For example, if a server is part of the Reports service and the Posting
service, it will be used for processes sent to either service.

#### How the Distributed Process Manager handles load balancing

The Distributed Process Manager (Dpm.exe) is the application that manages
the interaction between clients and process servers. The Dpm.exe application
is installed automatically on the computers in your Microsoft Dynamics GP
system. The following is a description of how DPM manages the load balancing
process.

1. DPM is started. You must keep DPM on after you start it.

2. Process servers are started. When you start each process server, the server
    is registered with DPM.

3. Clients are started. When each client machine is started, the setup
    information for servers and services is read and registered with DPM.

4. Processes are sent to services. When a client sends a process to a service,
    it asks DPM which server the process should be sent to. DPM examines the
    current processing load for the servers in the specified service, and tells
    the client to send the process to the process server with the lightest load.

If load balancing isn't enabled or DPM isn't operational, the process will
be sent to the first server in the specified service. If no process servers
are available, the process will be processed locally on the client.

1. Process servers and clients are shut down. When a process server is shut
    down, it tells DPM that it is no longer available. When the process server
    is restarted, it will re-register with DPM and be available for processing.

#### Distributed Process Server files

When you install Microsoft Dynamics GP, the Distributed Process Server and
the Distributed Process Manager are installed automatically on each
computer. The following table lists the components of the process server.

| **Application files on each process server**                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dynamics.exe (runtime engine) Dynamics.dic Dex.dic Dps.exe (Distributed Process Server engine) Dpm.exe (Distributed Process Manager engine) |

You can delete the Microsoft Dynamics GP runtime engine from the process
server; however, we recommend that you leave it so that you can start
Microsoft Dynamics GP on the process server, if necessary, to perform table
maintenance or other procedures.

Microsoft Dynamics GP will allow multiple instances of the a process server
to operate from the same client system. In a high-performance,
multiprocessor system, this type of setup can increase performance
dramatically. For more information, see [Multiple instances of DPS on the
same client](#multiple-instances-of-dps-on-the-same-client).

#### Distributed Process Manager file

The DPM is the application that tracks activity on all clients and process
servers. When a process is sent to a service, the DPM application determines
which process server has the lightest processing load and assigns the
process to that process server. When you install Microsoft Dynamics GP,
Dpm.exe is installed automatically on each computer.

To use load balancing with Microsoft Dynamics GP, you must use the
Distributed Process Manager application. The DPM computer can be a client,
data server, or process server. We recommend that it be extremely reliable
and not subject to processing interruptions; if the Dpm.exe application is
shut down unexpectedly, all remote processes and process servers can be
affected.

For more information on system requirements for the Distributed Process
Manager, see the Installation Instructions documentation.

### Chapter 9: Process server configuration

Use this information to help you determine the types of computers you'll use
as process servers and how to set up your Microsoft Dynamics GP clients,
servers, and process servers.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 35.png)



*For information about system requirements for process servers, see [Core system requirements for Microsoft Dynamics GP](system-requirements-core.md). 

The process server configuration information contains the following
sections:

- *Process server configuration guidelines*

- *DPS using services*

- *DPS on dedicated servers*

- *DPS on the data server*

- *DPS on a client*

#### Process server configuration guidelines

The best way to set up process servers depends on a variety of factors,
including the processing speed and RAM of all computers in your system, and
network traffic. Each system has unique circumstances and requirements.
Typically a configuration with one or more services, each containing three
or more process servers, results in the fastest and most efficient
processing.

The following information describes different ways you can set up process
servers. If performance isn't satisfactory in one configuration, you may
want to try a different configuration, which may improve performance. You
may find that a combination of these configurations works best for your
circumstances. You can set up as many process servers as necessary—as many
as your network protocol allows.

The possible configurations are as follows:

- *DPS using services*

- *DPS on dedicated servers*

- *DPS on the data server*

- *DPS on a client*

#### DPS using services

Typically, the best way to process tasks remotely is to use two to three or
more process servers to form one or more services. If you simply assign
processes to different process servers, one process server may have several
processes in its queue while another process server is idle. With a service,
you'll use the Distributed Process Manager to determine which process server
in a group the remote process should be sent to.

To decide how many computers to use in a service, evaluate the number of
users who will be processing tasks remotely, the processing speed of the
computers you'll use, and the length of the tasks you want to complete, such
as financial reports. In addition, consider whether it's important that the
tasks be completed as quickly as possible, or whether you simply want them
to be completed on computers other than your client computers.

For instance, if you have two Pentium class 2.8 GHz computers and two
Pentium class 3 GHz computers, you may want to create two services, one
containing the Pentium class 2.8s and one containing the Pentium 3s. You'd
then send tasks that need to be done quickly and which typically take more
time to the Pentium class 3 service, and other processes to the Pentium
class 2.8 service.

If it doesn't matter which tasks are completed more quickly, then you may
want to create one service containing all four computers.

To determine how many process servers you'll need, estimate how many process
servers could be kept completely busy by the processes you'll complete
remotely, then add one computer to that number, and group them in one or
more services.

The following illustration represents one service containing three process
servers:

<!--![A Screenshot](media/e7ad250b61c0c4be0b07981ba693bc4f.png)-->

#### DPS on dedicated servers

If you use one computer for your data server and separate computers for your
process servers, processing power won't need to be shared between data
processing tasks such as data entry, and remote process tasks such as
posting or printing.

The following illustration represents the DPS on a separate process server.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/cbd974239674b95d22b94fa20d1c4c7a.png)-->

#### DPS on the data server

Network traffic will be reduced in this configuration, since data processing
and remote processing will be performed on the same computer.

If the data server runs at capacity or close to capacity, you should set up
separate process servers to decrease the data server load and complete
remote processes more quickly.

The following illustration shows the DPS installed on the data server:

<!--![](media/e323d6cf753295eddd0b803e8f8a738d.png)-->

#### DPS on a client

You can use any client in your Microsoft Dynamics GP system as a process
server, even if you use it for data entry. To make a client a process
server, install the DPS engine and assign processes to it.

If you use this configuration, performance will likely be slower than in a
system with dedicated process servers. The client you use as a process
server shouldn't be used for frequent data entry; if it's used for data
entry only during the day, for instance, you can use it for remote processes
you complete overnight.

### Chapter 10: Remote processing setup

When you set up remote processing for your system, you'll specify which
tasks will be completed on the process servers, and which process servers
will be grouped in services.

The processing setup information is divided into the following sections:

- *Multiple instances of DPS on the same client*

- *Designating process servers*

- *Removing a server*

- *Creating a service*

- *Removing a service*

- *Setting up remote processing*

- *Enabling remote processes*

- *Setting up printers for remote processing*

- *Setting up report destinations for remote processing*

- *Setting up reports dictionaries for remote processing*

#### Multiple instances of DPS on the same client

Microsoft Dynamics GP will allow multiple instances of the process server to
operate from the same client system. In a high-performance, multiprocessor
system, this type of setup can increase performance of the system
dramatically.

Each instance of the DPS on the client needs its own separate copy of the
Microsoft Dynamics GP client code in its own directory:

First instance of DPS C:\\DPS1 Second instance of DPS C:\\DPS2 Third instance of DPS C:\\DPS3

The following line must be added to the Dex.ini file in each of the above
listed directories:

C:\\DPS1\\Dex.ini DPSInstance=1

C:\\DPS2\\Dex.ini DPSInstance=2

C:\\DPS3\\Dex.ini DPSInstance=3

Once these changes are made, define the DPS instances in the DPS Setup
window or the DPS Server Setup window. Each instance should be given the
host name of the DPS machine, followed by the "\#" symbol and the instance
number.

Server1\#1 (for DPS1) Server1\#2 (for DPS2) Server1\#3 (for DPS3)

The instances can then be assigned to a specific task, or to one or more
services.

#### Designating process servers

Use the DPS Server Setup window to enter the host names of the computers
you'll use as process servers. A host name is the unique name by which a
computer is known on a network.

**To designate process servers:**

1. Open the DPS Server Setup window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Process Server \>\> Servers
button)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 36.jpg)

1. Type the host name (sometimes known as the computer name) of a process
    server you'll use in the Server Host field.

2. Mark the Verify Connection On Add option to verify that you can connect to
    that process server from the computer you're currently using.

3. Choose Add.

If the connection is working and the process server is active, the server
host name will be added to the list. If not, a message will alert you that
the computer can't be contacted. Verify that you entered a valid host name;
if necessary, refer to the network protocol information in your Installation
Instructions documentation and the documentation provided with your network
protocol to determine the cause of the problem.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->S



*If the Verify Connection On Add option isn't marked, the server will be
added to the list even if you can't currently contact the process server.*

1. Repeat these steps to add the host name of each computer you'll use as a
    process server, then choose OK to return to the DPS Setup window.

#### Removing a server

To remove a server, select it in the DPS Setup window and choose Delete. It
will be removed from the list and from any service it's part of. If you make
any modification to a service, such as deleting a server, restart the
Distributed Process Manager.

#### Creating a service

Use the DPS Service Setup window to create groups of process servers called
services. Typically, the best way to process tasks remotely is to use two or
more process servers to form services. With a service and Microsoft Dynamics
GP, you can use the Distributed Process Manager to determine which process
server in a service the process should be sent to.

**To create a service:**

1. Open the DPS Service Setup window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Process Server \>\> Services
button)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 37.jpg)

1. Type the name of the service in the Services field.

2. Choose the Add button. The names of the process servers you've set up will
    be listed in the Configured Servers list.

3. Select each process server you want to add to the service and choose Insert.

You can create as many services as you need. A server can belong to more
than one service. To create additional services, repeat steps 2 through 4.

1. Choose OK to return to the DPS Setup window.

#### Removing a service

To delete a service, open the DPS Service Setup window, select the service
in the Services list and choose Delete. If you make any modification to a
service, such as deleting a server, restart the Distributed Process Manager.

#### Setting up remote processing

Use the DPS Setup window to specify which processes you want to complete on
process servers, such as batch posting and printing reports for each client.

Before you begin, be sure you've set up process servers and services. You
can enter servers in the DPS Setup window without setting them up in the DPS
Server Setup window, but the existence of those servers won't be verified.

**To set up remote processing:**

1. Open the DPS Setup window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Process Server)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 38.jpg)

1. In the DPS Setup window, select the series for the processes you want to set
    up for remote processing, or select All to display all processes.

2. Mark the box in the Remote column by each process that you want to assign to
    a process server. If you want all the available processes for the selected
    series to be processed remotely, choose Mark All. If you want to deactivate
    remote processing for all processes, choose Unmark All.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 39.jpg)



*These processes will be processed remotely only if the user has chosen to
process them remotely, using the User Preferences window. For more
information, see Enabling remote processes on page 59.*

1. Enter the server ID (host name) or service where each task will be
    processed.

If you've entered servers in this window without setting up the servers in
the DPS Server Setup window, the existence of those servers won't be
verified. All services you enter must have been set up already in the DPS
Service Setup window.

If more than one instance of Distributed Process Server exists on a process
server, specify which instance of DPS you're using on the server. For
example:

Server1\# (for DPS1) Server1\#2 (for DPS2)

For more information about multiple instances of Distributed Process Server,
see [Multiple instances of DPS on the same client](#multiple-instances-of-dps-on-the-same-client).

1. Mark the Track Start and End Times option if you want to record the start
    and end times of remote process activity in the Process Server Activity
    Table. If this option isn't marked, only alert messages will be recorded in
    the table.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->



> [!NOTE]
> The Process Server Activity Table can become large in a short time if you choose to track the start and end times of all processes.

See [Chapter 11, "Processing and monitoring remote processes](#chapter-11-processing-and-monitoring-remote-processes), for
information about viewing, printing, and removing the information in the
Process Server Activity Table.

1. Mark the Enable Load Balancing option if you're using services.

The Manager Host field will appear if Enable Load Balancing is marked; enter
the host name of the computer where you are using the Distributed Process
Manager. At this point, the DPS Setup window should resemble the following
illustration:

<!--![A screenshot ](media/657df4011a3dd42c47b326fbc88fafd5.jpg)-->

1. When you have finished marking processes and entering server IDs for the
    selected series, select another series and set up the processes you want to
    distribute to a remote processor or service.

2. When you've finished entering setup information for all series, choose OK to
    save the entries and close the window.

To review the process information you've entered, choose File \>\> Print
while the DPS Setup window is displayed to print the Process Server Setup
List.

#### Enabling remote processes

Use the User Preferences window to enable remote processing for each user.
You must complete this procedure for each user who will use remote
processes.

If the processes are set to process locally, then the entries in the DPS
Setup window are ignored and the processes will occur on the local computer.

**To enable remote processes:**

1. Open the User Preferences window.

(Home \>\> User Preferences)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 40.jpg)

1. Mark Local or Remote for the Distributed Processes option.

2. Choose OK to save the information you've entered and close the User
    Preferences window.

#### Setting up printers for remote processing

Once you begin a remote process, no additional input—such as responding to
dialog boxes or specifying print destinations—is required. All processes
sent to a printer will be printed to the default printer for the
corresponding process server; users can't specify the printer when they
begin the process. For this reason, you may want to set up several process
servers if it's important that certain processes be sent to a specific
printer. For more information about printers, see [Chapter 2, "Printers](#chapter-2-printers).

#### Setting up report destinations for remote processing

If any of the following situations apply to your system, be sure your report
file locations are set up correctly.

If you print reports to files on process servers, the files should be stored
on the process server. If you enter C:\\Microsoft Dynamics GP\\Report.txt as
the report file name, for instance, the report will be stored on the C:
drive of the process server, not the C: drive of the client you used to
begin the process.

In addition, be sure you don't print reports to the screen if the report
will be processed remotely. Typically, the Screen option won't be available
if you've set up a process to be performed remotely. However, if you set up
a report to be printed to the screen and processed locally, then decide to
process it remotely, you must change the report destination, as well.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 41.jpg)



*You might receive a path not valid error if the folder location is on your
process server, but not on your client computer.*

Use the Posting Setup window to set up report destinations for reports you
want to print. For more information refer to your System Setup documentation
(Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting Up the System). Be sure that you set
up report destinations in this window according to these guidelines.

#### Setting up reports dictionaries for remote processing

When you use Report Writer to create a primary copy of a report, it is
stored in a dictionary file called Reports.dic. (Reports.dic is the name of
the Microsoft Dynamics GP reports dictionary; reports dictionaries for
integrating products have different names.) You can process only primary
copies of reports on process servers; secondary copies and custom reports
can't be processed remotely.

For information about creating primary copies and configuring reports
dictionaries, refer to your Report Writer documentation.

If the processes that you complete remotely contain reports that are primary
copies—for instance, if you're using a primary copy of a posting journal—the
process server must be set up to access the correct reports dictionary. This
may be on the client, at a network location, or on the process server.

If you're using two or more reports dictionaries—for instance, if each user
has a separate local reports dictionary—you'll need to set up your process
servers so that each one accesses the correct reports dictionary.

**Modified reports**

If you want to process primary copies of reports remotely, the client and
server must access the same reports dictionary. For instance, if a user's
launch file on a client lists J:\\Microsoft Dynamics GP as the location for
the reports dictionary, the launch file on the process server must specify
that location for the reports dictionary, as well. If the process server
can't access the reports dictionary where a primary copy is stored, the
original report will be printed instead.

You can allow users to print primary copies remotely by storing a reports
dictionary on a process server. If you store the reports dictionary on the
process server, printing will be faster than if it's stored at the user's
computer.

To be sure the process server is accessing the correct reports dictionary,
open the launch file. The launch file, typically called Dynamics.set,
contains the location of the application dictionaries, forms dictionaries,
and reports dictionaries you're using. In the following example, the reports
dictionary is stored at a central network location.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 42.png)

To edit the launch file, you can use the Edit Launch File window in
Microsoft

Dynamics GP, or edit the file using a text editor. See *Editing a launch
file using the Edit Launch File window* on page 80 and *Editing a launch
file using a text editor* on page 82 for instructions.

- To open the Edit Launch File window: Start Microsoft Dynamics GP (not DPS)
    on the process server. Choose Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\>
    Edit Launch File.

- To edit using a text editor in Windows, use Notepad.

**One reports dictionary that all users access**

If you're using one reports dictionary that all users access, be sure that
the launch file on each process server contains the location of that reports
dictionary. In the following example, all clients and process servers access
a dictionary stored at a network location.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 43.png)

You also can store the reports dictionary on the process server, to reduce
network traffic.

**Two or more reports dictionaries**

If you're using two or more reports dictionaries, you can use one process
server for each user, or have some users process tasks only locally (see
*Enabling remote processes* on page 59).

In the following example, each client accesses its own process server, so
that the client and process server use the same reports dictionary.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/2b5bb39073e32bc5cfb703af58baf1bd.png)-->

In the next example, the first and third clients process locally all tasks
that include primary copies of reports. The second client remotely processes
tasks including primary copies, and the process server accesses that
client's report dictionary.

Reports.dic Reports.dic Reports.dic

### Chapter 11: Processing and monitoring remote processes

Use the following information to learn how to start the Distributed Process
Manager, view tasks being completed, and view logged information about
remote processes.

The information contains the following sections:

- *Starting the Distributed Process Manager*

- *Monitoring background processes*

- *Viewing process detail*

- *Viewing process information*

- *Removing and printing remote process information*

#### Starting the Distributed Process Manager

When you've configured your process servers and are ready to begin using
your multiuser system, follow the instructions in this procedure to start
the components of the system in the correct order.

**To start the Distributed Process Manager:**

1. Shut down the computer where you are using the Distributed Process Manager,
    all process servers, and all client computers.

2. Start the computer where you are using DPM, and launch the Distributed
    Process Manager. (On the DPM computer, double-click the DPM icon or drag the
    Dynamics.set file onto the Dpm.exe file.)

3. Start each process server computer.

4. Start each client computer.

5. Launch Microsoft Dynamics GP on each client computer.

#### Monitoring background processes

The Process Monitor window displays the Microsoft Dynamics GP processes
(such

as printing reports and posting journals) being performed locally in the
background, or remotely by process servers.

**To monitor background processes:**

1. Within Process Server, open the Process Monitor window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Process Monitor or drag the Dynamics.set
file onto the Dps.exe file on the client.)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 44.jpg)

The name of the processes will be displayed in the Process list. The
currently active process will appear at the top of the list. The number of
steps in each process in the list is displayed in parentheses next to the
process name.

1. Select whether to view Timed or Normal processes. Timed processes are those
    scheduled to be performed on a particular date and time, or to recur at a
    predefined interval.

2. Select a location you want to view processes for. You can select local,
    remote, or process server.

**Local** Allows you to view a list of processes initiated from the current
workstation that are being performed locally, at the workstation.

**Remote** Allows you to view a list of processes initiated from the current
workstation that are being performed by any of the process servers accessed
by the current workstation.

**Process Server** Allows you to view a list of all processes currently
being performed by a specific process server, regardless of which client
sent the process to that process server. If you select Process Server as the
location, you will not be able to view process details in the Process Detail
window.

1. If you've selected Process Server as the Location, specify the server for
    which you want to display processes. If you're using the Process Monitor
    window on the process server computer, you can view only the processes
    performed on that server—Local.

2. To view information about any process in the list, highlight the process;
    the status will be displayed below the list. The name of the server also
    will be displayed.

The following are possible statuses:

| **Status** | **Description**                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Active     | The process is currently processing.                    |
| Ready      | The process is queued and awaiting activation.          |
| Error      | An error has occurred and the process has been canceled. |

1. To pause all processes being performed locally in the background, choose
    Suspend. To restart all background processes, choose Resume.

You can suspend only the processes being performed locally in the
background; not any processes on process servers. If you are using the
Process Monitor window on the process server, you can suspend the processes
on that server.

1. To remove processes, highlight the process and choose Remove. You can remove
    reports from the queue as long as they aren't currently active.

Processes that can be removed are indicated with a "\>" sign:

\> General Ledger: Trial Balance Report(2)

1. To view detailed information about a process, choose the Detail button The
    Process Detail window will appear, displaying detailed information about the
    selected process. For more information, see *Viewing process detail* on page

2. To update the process list, choose Redisplay.

#### Viewing process detail

Each process can involve several steps. For example, the check link process
involves checking links, checking the error log, and printing an error
report. The number of steps in each process in the list will be displayed in
parentheses next to the process name in the Process Monitor window.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->



*If you select Process Server as the location in the Process Monitor window,
you will not be able to view process details in the Process Detail window.*

**To view process detail:**

To view detailed information about a process, select the process in the
Process Monitor window and choose Detail. The Process Detail window will
appear, displaying detailed information about the selected process.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 45.jpg)

If the process is a procedure, only the name of the procedure will appear in
the window. A procedure is a script that can be called from other scripts to
perform a common function. If the process is a group of steps, each step in
the process group will appear.

To view information about any step in the list, highlight the step; the
status of the step and its type (report or procedure) will be displayed
below the list.

*Timed Entry Info fields only appear if the currently highlighted process
entry is a recurring or scheduled process.*

#### Viewing process information

The Process Server Inquiry window shows information about the outcome of
processes that have been sent to process servers. Processes that weren't
completed because an error occurred will be displayed. For example, as a process
is performed by a process server, any alert messages generated by the process
are recorded in the Process Server Activity Table.

Processes that are waiting to be performed by process servers will not be
displayed; to view these processes, use the Process Monitor window.

**To view process information:**

1. Open the Process Server Inquiry window.

(Administration \>\> Inquiry \>\> System \>\> Process Server)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 46.jpg)

1. Select a sorting option. You can view information about the processes sent
    to this server by date or by user ID.

2. Select the ID of the server.

3. Choose the Redisplay button to update the list. The start and end times of
    remote activities will be displayed if you marked the Track Start and End
    Times option in the DPS Setup window.

You can use the Remove Process Server Detail window to remove or print the
information displayed in this window. Only the information that's been
written to the Process Server Activity Table since the last time you removed
data from the table will be displayed. See *Removing and printing remote
process information* on page 69.

#### Removing and printing remote process information

Use the Remove Process Server Detail window to remove records from the
Process Server Activity Table, print a report detailing the information in
the table, or both.

When a process is performed by a process server on your network, information
about the outcome of that process is recorded in the Process Server Activity
Table. This information includes any alert messages that occurred while the
task was processed. The table size can increase very quickly if many
activities are performed by process servers, especially if you have the
Track Start and End Times option marked in the DPS Setup window, so you may
need to remove data from the table periodically.

<!--![](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*Before removing process server detail, back up your company's data.*

**To remove and print remote process information:**

1. Open the Remove Process Server Detail window.

(Administration \>\> Utilities \>\> System \>\> Process Server)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 47.jpg)

1. Enter server and date restrictions by selecting Server ID or Date from the
    Ranges listing and enter a range in the From and To fields. Choose Insert
    and the range will appear in the Restrictions box.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*If you don't specify any server or date restrictions, all records will be
included. You can enter only one range of dates and one range of server
IDs.*

1. Select whether to remove records, print a report, or both. You can print the
    Process Server Log Report without removing records by selecting only the
    Print Report option.

2. Choose Process to print the report and remove records.

## Part 4: Technical reference

This part of the documentation contains technical information on how
Microsoft Dynamics GP runs. In it, you'll find detailed information about
integrating products, launch files, and defaults files.

The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 12, "Integrating products,"* provides an overview of the
    multidictionary environment.

- *Chapter 13, "Launch files,"* provides information about how to use, create,
    and edit launch files.

- *Chapter 14, "Defaults files,"* describes how to use and edit the Dex.ini
    file, which contains setup and operating information about Microsoft
    Dynamics GP.

### Chapter 12: Integrating products

Microsoft Dynamics GP can be used with other programs, called **integrating products**, that work simultaneously with Microsoft Dynamics GP. Integrating
products provide an additional application dictionary that works with the
Microsoft Dynamics GP engine and other files to present a functioning
integrating application. Since two or more application dictionaries can be
used, this system is called a **multidictionary environment**.

The integrating products information is divided into the following sections:

- *Types of dictionaries*

- *Multidictionary environment example*

- *Modifying reports for an integrating product*

- *Modifying windows for an integrating product*

#### Types of dictionaries

An application dictionary contains all the resources that make a product
unique, including its windows, reports, and how it works. In the
multidictionary environment of Microsoft Dynamics GP, you'll use two types
of application dictionaries:

- A **main dictionary** is used to access resources in integrating
    dictionaries. The Microsoft Dynamics GP application dictionary
    (Dynamics.dic) is always considered the main dictionary in a multidictionary
    environment.

- An **integrating dictionary** contains information about an integrating
    product and runs simultaneously with the main dictionary. Integrating
    dictionaries may access Microsoft Dynamics GP resources, such as fields or
    reports, as well as their own resources. All application dictionaries that
    operate with Microsoft Dynamics GP in a multidictionary environment are
    considered integrating dictionaries.

When you install each integrating product, information about it is added to
the launch file (typically Dynamics.set) so that the product will be started
with Microsoft Dynamics GP. For more information about launch files, see
*Chapter 13,*

*"Launch files."*

#### Multidictionary environment example

In this example, the application dictionary for Microsoft Dynamics GP is the
main dictionary in a multidictionary environment with two integrating
dictionaries.

The runtime engine is used to interpret each dictionary.

The main dictionary in a multidictionary environment.

Integrating dictionaries contain separate resources and also can access
resources in the main dictionary.

A launch file lists the application dictionaries.

#### Modifying reports for an integrating product

Each application dictionary has its own reports dictionary, where reports
modified and created using Report Writer are stored. The reports dictionary
for Microsoft Dynamics GP is called Reports.dic. Dictionaries for other
products can have other names, but must use the extension .DIC. The
locations of the reports dictionaries for other products are stored in the
launch file, as well.

When you've installed integrating products, you must select which products'
reports you want to modify when you use Report Writer. For more information,
refer to your Report Writer documentation.

#### Modifying windows for an integrating product

Each application dictionary has its own forms dictionary, where modified
windows are stored. The forms dictionary for Microsoft Dynamics GP is called
Forms.dic; dictionaries for other products can have other names, but must
use the extension .DIC. The locations of the forms dictionaries for other
products are stored in the launch file, as well.

When you've installed integrating products, you must select which products'
windows you want to modify when you use the Modifier. For more information
about the Modifier and the forms dictionaries, refer to your Modifier User's
Guide documentation. For more information about setting access to modified
windows and reports, refer to your System Setup Guide (Help \>\> Contents
\>\> Select Setting up the System).

### Chapter 13: Launch files

A launch file is used to list each product and the locations of its
application dictionary, forms dictionary, and reports dictionary. The launch
file indicates which dictionaries and products should be started when you
start Microsoft Dynamics GP.

Launch files are located only on client computers, or data servers that also
can be used as clients, because dictionaries are installed only on clients.

The launch files information contains the following sections:

- *Launch files overview*

- *Where to store dictionaries*

- *Lines in a launch file*

- *Example launch file using integrating products*

- *Example launch file using multiple location IDs*

- *Example launch file using central dictionaries*

- *Creating a launch file*

- *Editing a launch file using the Edit Launch File window*

- *Editing a launch file using a text editor*

- *Troubleshooting launch files*

#### Launch files overview

Launch files are located only on client computers, or data servers that also
can be used as clients, because dictionaries are installed only on clients.
Each client has a separate launch file for each product you install. This
allows each computer to have different instructions for starting Microsoft
Dynamics GP, if necessary. You can create additional launch files or modify
an existing file.

A launch file for Microsoft Dynamics GP with local dictionary locations is
created each time you install Microsoft Dynamics GP or its engine. A launch
file for Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities with local dictionary locations is
created each time you install either application.

When you start Microsoft Dynamics GP, you indicate the launch file you're
using by double-clicking a program item that lists the Microsoft Dynamics GP
engine and the corresponding launch file in its properties. You also can
start Microsoft Dynamics GP by dragging the launch file, typically
Dynamics.set, over the Microsoft Dynamics GP engine file, Dynamics.exe. The
engine reads the launch file to determine which dictionaries will be used,
then opens those dictionaries to present the functioning application.

A separate launch file is also created for Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities
and functions the same way, except that integrating products can't be used.
When you drag the Dynutils.set file (the launch file for Microsoft Dynamics
GP Utilities) over the engine, the resources in the Microsoft Dynamics GP
Utilities application dictionary (Dynutils.set) will be used.

If you're using two or more launch files to use Microsoft Dynamics GP in
different configurations, you can modify the existing Microsoft Dynamics GP
item's or shortcut's properties, create additional items or shortcuts that
will access other launch files, and modify the Microsoft Dynamics GP item or
shortcut so that you can select the launch file you want to use each time
you start Microsoft Dynamics GP.

You can view the contents of any launch file (any file with a .SET
extension) using a text editor such as Notepad; make changes, if necessary,
then close. Be sure to start Notepad and then open the file, rather than
double-clicking the file; double-clicking the launch file will start the
corresponding application.

*We do not recommend using Write for Windows to open a launch file.*

#### Where to store dictionaries

Depending on the server you are using and how your network is set up, you
can store forms and reports dictionaries locally on each client, on the
server, or on a network volume. To store dictionaries on a network volume,
the necessary volumes must be set up correctly and using the appropriate
network software in order to allow the Microsoft Dynamics GP engine on each
client to locate forms and reports dictionaries on the network. The
Dynamics.dic and the Microsoft Dynamics GP engine must be on the client.
Refer to your operating system documentation for information about
connecting volumes in a network. If your system hasn't been set up to allow
client computers to access files other than Microsoft Dynamics GP tables on
the server or network volumes, you must store dictionaries locally on all
clients.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 54.gif)

*We recommend that you always store application dictionaries locally for
best performance; storing forms and reports dictionaries locally improves
performance, as well. For more information, see your Report Writer
documentation and the Modifier documentation.*

#### Lines in a launch file

A launch file is composed of a number of lines, depending on whether you're
using only Microsoft Dynamics GP, or integrating products, as well. In the
launch files for Microsoft Dynamics GP and Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities,
the forms and reports dictionary lines must be included, but don't affect
how either application works. Some lines in the Microsoft Dynamics GP
Utilities launch file may not contain dictionary locations until after you
start each application for the first time.

The following information shows all the line information that could appear
in the Dynamics.set file.

| **Line**                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **When to use**                                                  | **Example**                               |

#### Example launch file using integrating products

If you've installed integrating products, dictionary location information
will be listed for those products. Each product has a separate application
dictionary, forms dictionary, and reports dictionary, and the location for
each must be listed in the launch file for each user to access that product.

The following example shows the information in the Dynamics.set file on a
Windows client after product information has been added for two integrating
products, Lead Tracking and Time and Billing.

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 55.jpg)

On client computers where the defaults file **Workstation2** setting is
Windows, all three sets of dictionary locations will be used, so that the
Lead Tracking and Time and Billing products can be opened. Since Microsoft
Dynamics GP is the main product (indicated by its product ID of 0), it will
be opened first. For more information on defaults files, see *Chapter 14,
"Defaults files."*

#### Example launch file using multiple location IDs

To use more than one forms or reports dictionary for a product, you can add
dictionary location IDs and corresponding dictionary locations to a launch
file and distribute the launch file to the affected users. In addition, you
can control which integrating products users access. For example, you can
create a launch file for one group of users listing only Microsoft Dynamics
GP, and a launch file for another group of users listing Microsoft Dynamics
GP and the integrating products you've installed.

If you add dictionary location IDs to a launch file or change an existing
dictionary location ID, you must make the same change in the defaults file
where it's stored.

For more information, see *How launch files and defaults files work
together* on page 85.

In the following example, the user will be asked to select a dictionary
location ID the first time he or she logs in to Microsoft Dynamics GP. Users
who select the Local Reports dictionary location ID will use a reports
dictionary stored on their hard disk and create a separate set of reports.
Users who select the Network Reports dictionary location ID will access a
common reports dictionary on a network volume. You may want to set up launch
files in this way if certain users need specialized reports while others use
a common set.

<!--![A screenshot ](media/628e7d401bf34793e0b2aa1dd8b89500.jpg)-->

#### Example launch file using central dictionaries

You can store your Microsoft Dynamics GP, forms, and reports dictionaries in
a central location and modify the launch files to reflect that.

Use the appropriate operating system tools to be sure the data server or
process server is connected correctly, so that each client can access the
location where the dictionaries are located. Use the volume ID used when you
set up these connections as the volume ID in the dictionary location.

If you store dictionaries on a process server or data server, and the
process server or data server and the client use different platforms, you
may not be able to access those dictionaries by entering the volume letter
of the process server. In this case, place the dictionary on a network
volume that the process server and all clients can access. Edit the launch
file of the process server so that the location on the network volume is
indicated.

The following example shows the launch files for Windows clients accessing
dictionaries stored on a data server.

<!--![A screenshot ](media/b425984db2e4c6c323d1c0d1d93efd11.jpg)-->

#### Creating a launch file

Use this checklist to create a launch file. See *Editing a launch file using
the Edit Launch File window* on page 80 and *Editing a launch file using a
text editor* on page 82 for descriptions of how to change the information in
a launch file.

**To create a launch file:**

1. Be sure the Microsoft Dynamics GP engine is in the same folder with all
    application dictionaries.

2. Double-click the Dynamics.exe file. Microsoft Dynamics GP will be started in
    minimized form; maximize it to display the File menu.

3. Choose File \>\> Create Launch File; a dialog box will appear. Dynamics.set
    will be displayed as the default name for the new launch file.

4. Accept the name or enter a new one, then choose OK or Save.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*If you don't accept the default name, be sure to modify the properties of
the Microsoft Dynamics GP program item so that the correct launch file will
be used when you start Microsoft Dynamics GP.*

To start Microsoft Dynamics GP using the launch file you just created,
choose File \>\> Open Launch File; a dialog box will appear. Select the
launch file and choose OK; the Login window will be displayed.

1. Close Microsoft Dynamics GP. The new launch file will contain the following
    information:

    - The number of application dictionaries on your hard disk, the product
        ID, and the product name corresponding to each application dictionary.

    - A dictionary location ID, typically "Windows."

    - The location of the main product's application dictionary, forms
        dictionary, and reports dictionary (the folder where the Microsoft
        Dynamics GP engine is located).

    - If integrating products were installed, their application dictionary,
        forms dictionary and reports dictionary locations will be listed, as
        well.

#### Editing a launch file using the Edit Launch File window

Typically, it's not necessary to edit launch files unless one is damaged or
deleted, or if you change the location of your forms or reports
dictionaries. If you move dictionaries or create additional launch files,
you'll need to enter current information about where your dictionaries are
located, or modify the launch file to start only certain products. A launch
file is any file with a .SET extension that was installed with Microsoft
Dynamics GP or that you've created using the instructions in this section.

Use the following checklist to change dictionary locations in Microsoft
Dynamics GP using the Edit Launch File window. You can also edit launch
files using a text editor, such as Notepad. See *Editing a launch file using
a text editor* on page 82 for more information.

**To edit a launch file using the Edit Launch File window:**

1. Open the Edit Launch File window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Edit Launch File)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 56.jpg)

1. Select a launch file. The launch file used to start the current session of
    Microsoft Dynamics GP will be displayed in the Launch File field. To select
    a different launch file to edit, choose the file button to display a dialog
    box where you can select a launch file. Choose OK.

2. Select a product. The scrolling window displays the products, including
    Microsoft Dynamics GP and any integrating products you're using with Microsoft Dynamics GP, that are opened using the launch file displayed in the Launch File field. Select the product you want to edit dictionary location information for.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*To remove a product from the launch file, or to restore a product ID and
name of an integrating product you deleted from the launch file you're
editing, you must use a text editor.*

1. Select your dictionary location ID. The name displayed corresponds to a set
    of locations for the selected product's application dictionary, forms
    dictionary, and reports dictionary. If you're not sure of your dictionary
    location ID, you can check it by viewing the **Workstation2** setting in
    your Dex.ini file.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*The changes you make to the dictionary location ID will affect only the
dictionaries opened on your computer.*

1. Enter dictionary locations. The current location of the application
    dictionary, forms dictionary, and reports dictionary for the launch file and
    product you selected are displayed in the Dictionary Locations fields.

<!-- ![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*To specify a different location for a dictionary, choose the corresponding
file button. A dialog box will be displayed; specify the new location and
choose OK.*

If you want to be able to access windows or reports you've already created,
move the dictionary containing them to the new location. If you enter a
location for the forms and reports dictionaries where a forms or reports
dictionary doesn't exist, a new, empty dictionary will be created there the
next time you access Modifier or Report Writer.

1. If you're editing the launch file you used to start the current session of
    Microsoft Dynamics GP, restart Microsoft Dynamics GP to allow the changes to
    take effect.

#### Editing a launch file using a text editor

Use the following information to make extensive changes to a launch file
using a text editor.

Typically, it's not necessary to edit launch files unless one is damaged or
deleted, or if you change the location of your forms or reports
dictionaries. If you move dictionaries or create additional launch files,
you'll need to edit the launch files to enter current information about
where your dictionaries are located, or modify the launch file to start only
certain products.

You can add dictionary location IDs so that different locations will be used
for a product's dictionaries, depending on which dictionary location ID is
selected by the user and stored in the computer's Dex.ini file. If you add
dictionary location IDs to a launch file or change an existing dictionary
location ID, you must make the same change in the defaults files where it's
stored. For more information, see *How launch files and defaults files work
together* on page 85.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->



*If you use more than one dictionary location ID, you must list the
dictionaries for every product you're using for each dictionary location ID.
If every product isn't listed, Microsoft Dynamics GP won't be opened
correctly. If you want two users to access a different number of products,
you must create a launch file for each.*

**To edit a launch file using a text editor:**

1. Make a backup of the launch file or print it before you edit it.

2. Open the launch file by choosing File \>\> Open in Notepad or another text
    editor.

<!--![](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*We recommend that you do not edit a launch file using Write for Windows.*

1. Remove integrating products. If you don't want an integrating product to be
    available to certain users, create a launch file for them without the
    product's ID, name, dictionary location ID, or dictionary locations. Be sure
    to modify the number at the beginning of the launch file, which indicates
    the total number of application dictionaries in the launch file.

2. Review *Lines in a launch file* on page 76; be sure to make any additional
    entries in the correct position in the launch file.

3. Be sure there are no blank lines in the launch file, then save changes and
    close it.

4. If you want to be able to access windows or reports you've already created,
    move the dictionary containing them to the new location.

If you entered a location for the forms and reports dictionaries where a
forms or reports dictionary doesn't exist, a new, empty dictionary will be
created there the next time you access Modifier or Report Writer.

1. Start Microsoft Dynamics GP using the new launch file. If you removed the
    dictionary location ID from the **Workstation2** setting, you'll be prompted
    to select a dictionary location ID from the IDs currently in the launch
    file.

#### Troubleshooting launch files

If you made changes to a launch file, use these instructions to be sure
Microsoft Dynamics GP is working properly.

**Product listed in the launch file isn't installed**

If a product listed in the launch file isn't installed in the specified
location, a dialog box will appear when you start Microsoft Dynamics GP.
Choose OK; you'll be able start Microsoft Dynamics GP without installing the
product or removing it from the launch file.

**Existing dictionary location IDs are modified**

If you've modified existing dictionary location IDs, edit the
**Workstation2** setting of the Dex.ini file for each user's computer.
Dictionary location IDs are case-sensitive; if "Windows" appears in your
Dex.ini file, for instance, and "windows" appears in your launch file, the
dictionary locations for the Windows dictionary location ID won't be used.

If the defaults file **Workstation2** setting contains a dictionary location
ID that's no longer in the launch file, when you start Microsoft Dynamics GP
a message will prompt you to add it to the launch file. If this occurs,
don't add the ID; choose No and verify the **Workstation2** setting and the
dictionary location IDs in the launch file to be sure you edited each
correctly. (If you add the ID, that dictionary location ID will be added for
all products in the launch file.) Then restart Microsoft Dynamics GP and, if
you wish, add the dictionary location ID to the launch file.

If you add dictionary location IDs, change each user's **Workstation2**
setting in the defaults file to the correct ID, or remove the ID so that
each user will be prompted to select from the IDs in the launch file. For
more information, see *How launch files and defaults files work together* on
page 85.

### Chapter 14: Defaults files

The Microsoft Dynamics GP defaults file contains setup and operating
information about Microsoft Dynamics GP. Each line of information, or
setting, in the file contains information such as where your files are
located, and whether certain functions, such as displaying print dialog
boxes, should be performed. The defaults file is named Dex.ini. This type of
file is sometimes referred to as an initialization file.

The Dex.ini file is installed in the Microsoft Dynamics GP folder (the
folder where the Microsoft Dynamics GP engine is stored).

The defaults files information is divided into the following sections:

- *How launch files and defaults files work together*

- *Editing defaults files*

- *Damaged defaults files*

#### How launch files and defaults files work together

A launch file (Dynamics.set) works in conjunction with the **Workstation2**
line in the defaults file (Dex.ini) on each client computer. If you add
dictionary location IDs to a launch file or change an existing dictionary
location ID, you must make the same change in the defaults file where it's
stored.

For example, if you modify the dictionary location ID "Windows" in the
launch file and change it to "Windows Users," the "Windows" ID is still
stored in the

**Workstation2** setting in the defaults file of all Windows computers. In
this situation, you would change the **Workstation2** setting on each
Windows computer from "Windows" to "Windows Users," so that the dictionary
locations for the "Windows" dictionary location ID are used.

If you add another dictionary ID to the launch file, you must change the

**Workstation2** setting in the intended users' defaults files to reflect
the dictionary ID they should use. Alternately, you can delete the
**Workstation2** setting. Users with no **Workstation2** line and launch
files with multiple dictionary location IDs must select a dictionary
location ID when they start Microsoft Dynamics GP for the first time. A new
**Workstation2** line is added to the Dex.ini, with the dictionary location
ID they selected.

#### Editing defaults files

To edit the Dex.ini file, use Windows Notepad to open the file, then edit
existing parameters or add settings and parameters. Be sure to include an
equal sign for each setting, before the parameter.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*We recommend that you do not edit the Dex.ini file using Windows Write. The
defaults file is essential for Microsoft Dynamics GP to run correctly;
always make a backup before you edit it, and don't edit any setting unless
you're instructed to do so by your reseller, or by Microsoft Dynamics GP
Technical Support.*

#### Damaged defaults files

If your defaults file is damaged or deleted, we recommend that you restore a
backup; if you re-create the file, you must reenter several of the settings.
Other settings that must be reentered vary, depending on your configuration.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you do not delete the defaults file if you want to re-create it. The defaults file is essential for Microsoft Dynamics GP to run correctly; always make a backup before you edit it, and don't edit any setting unless you're instructed to do so by your reseller, or by Microsoft Dynamics GP Technical Support.

#### Signs that data maintenance is needed

The most common indicator that data maintenance is needed is an alert message
that indicates an error in a specific table. However, data problems may not
always be this obvious and it may be more difficult to identify in which table
or tables it has occurred. Other indicators of data problems include:

- Alert messages that you can't explain

- Inaccurate data in windows or on reports

- Unusual characters in windows or on reports

- Windows you're unable to open

Once you've determined that a problem exists, you can use the following
questions to direct your troubleshooting effort.

If you are unable to fix the problem yourself, see *Before you call support* on
page 93 to gather information that will help your support technician solve the
problem.

**Does the error occur for a system administrator user?**

If a **system administrator user** does not receive the same error as other
users, a permission problem may exist.

A script called Grant.sql is included on the Microsoft Dynamics GP installation
media and is installed automatically during the Microsoft Dynamics GP client/
server installation process. Run this script against the database that produces
the error. For more information on running scripts, see the SQL Server
documentation.

**Does the error occur for all users?**

If the error does not occur for all users, a security problem may exist. You
should also check customizations, such as modified reports and forms.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*Remember that you have security options within SQL Server and within
Microsoft Dynamics GP.*

**Does the error occur in all companies?**

If the error occurs in more than one company and is data-related, the
problem is likely in the system database. The problem could also exist in
one of your dictionaries, such as Dynamics.dic or Reports.dic. If an error
occurs in only one company, the problem likely exists in the company
database.

**Does the error occur on all workstations?**

To determine if a problem is data-related or dictionary-related, verify
whether the error happens on all workstations. If all workstations produce
the same error, the problem is likely on the server rather than on the
individual client. The problem could be related to database tables or to
shared files. To determine where maintenance is needed, see *Finding which
tables require maintenance* on page 92.

**Does the error happen consistently?**

If an error occurs consistently, you probably need data maintenance. To
determine if a table is corrupt, try isolating records within the tables
you're working with. For more information on determining where the
maintenance is needed, see *Finding which tables require maintenance* on
page 92.

**Is the window or report modified?**

If the non-modified version of a window or report does not receive the
error, the problem is related to the modifications to the dictionary. If
recent modifications have been done, check the modifications for errors. If
the modifications have worked in the past, rename the dictionary and restore
it from a backup.

<!--![](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*Do not delete dictionaries. Renaming files allows you to restore these files
later, if necessary.*

**Are there integrating products or customizations?**

If there are customizations or integrating applications, try removing them
to see if errors still occur. If integrating applications are present,
remove the dictionaries from the Dynamics.set file and rename the associated
file extensions in Windows Explorer.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*Do not delete these files. Renaming file extensions allows you to restore
these files later, if necessary.*

If customizations exist on your system, contact the person who made the
customizations for troubleshooting assistance.

**If you're having printing problems, are you able to print to the screen, a
file, or another printer?**

When you notice a problem on a report or inquiry window, verify whether the
error occurs when you view the information using a different medium, such as
printed to the screen or to a different printer. If a report and its
associated inquiry window produce the same results, data maintenance is
needed. If only the report is incorrect, the problem could be related to a
modified report.

**Were the transactions imported or keyed?**

If imported transactions produce errors, verify whether manually keyed
transactions produce the same results. Because some methods of importing data do
not require the data to be verified for accuracy, imported data may be corrupt
or incomplete. To determine where maintenance is needed, see *Finding which
tables require maintenance* on page 92.

**Does the problem exist if processing is done at the database server?**

If the problem does not exist when all processing is performed at the server,
the problem may be related to your network, ODBC drivers, or ODBC data sources
or a result of differing MDAC versions.

#### Finding which tables require maintenance

Once you've established that a table requires maintenance in Microsoft Dynamics
GP, the next step is to find out which table or tables are affected. Once you've
determined which tables need to be repaired, see the data recovery checklist in
*Recovering data* on page 95.

- If an alert message has appeared stating the name of the table, you can
    begin the data recovery checklist immediately.

- If unusual results on a report indicate a table that a table requires
    maintenance, refer to the sample reports provided with the module to see
    which table groups' data is printed in that report.

- If you're having trouble opening a window, use the Window Descriptions
    window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions
    \>\> Windows) to determine the physical and table groups accessed by a
    window.

- If you still can't determine which table is causing the problem, try to
    isolate the problem. For example, if you're working in Sales Order
    Processing, try entering different types of transactions with various items
    for various customers. If the error occurs only for a specific customer
    record, you can conclude that the data in the RM Customer MSTR table is
    corrupt.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*Each Microsoft Dynamics GP table has three names: a display name, a
technical name, and a physical name. Display names are displayed in the
Check Links window and other windows. The table names that appear in alert
messages are typically technical names, the names that the system uses to
identify tables. For example, a message may state that an error occurred in
the GL_Account_MSTR table, but the display name for that table is Account
Master.*

You may need to use the Table Descriptions window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu
\>\>Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions \>\> Tables) to determine the table group
to which a table in an alert message belongs. Some data recovery procedures can
be performed only on table groups, while others can be performed on table groups
or tables.

#### Alert message troubleshooting

If you receive an error message that indicates a problem you can't explain, use
the following resources for more information. If you are unable to resolve the
problem yourself, contact Microsoft Dynamics GP Technical Support for other
options.

**Microsoft Dynamics GP messages**

The best source of information for troubleshooting Microsoft Dynamics GP alert messages is the Knowledge Base database on CustomerSource. Go to the Technical Q&A page, where you can type in the message number or message text to search for the alert message you're receiving.

**DBMS messages**

Microsoft SQL-related error messages appear as DBMS errors in Microsoft
Dynamics GP. Always use the SQL Server Books Online to troubleshoot DBMS
errors (Start \>\> Programs \>\> Microsoft SQL Server \>\> Books Online).
Select the Search tab and enter the error number, then choose List Topics.
Either highlight and select Display or double-click an entry to open the
topic. In the description column of the error message table, you'll see more
information about the error. You can also use the SQL Query Analyzer to find
the same information.

#### Before you call support

Have the answers ready to the following questions to help your support
specialist quickly narrow down the source of the problem you've
experiencing.

- What is the exact error message?

- When did the error first occur?

- What task were you attempting to perform at the time you received the error
    message?

- Has the task been completed successfully in the past?

- What is the name of the window you are you working in?

- What have you done so far to attempt to fix the problem?

- Have you performed any of the table maintenance procedures such as check
    links?

- If have performed table maintenance procedures and received error messages,
    what kind of messages?

- Does the problem occur in another company?

- Does the problem occur on another workstation?

- Does the problem occur for more than one user?

- What versions of software are you using?

Verify the version numbers for Microsoft Dynamics GP, your database
software, and Windows. Also note service packs.

- Are you using an integrating product with Microsoft Dynamics GP?

- Have you imported any data?

### Chapter 16: Data recovery

The Microsoft Dynamics GP system is designed to ensure maximum accuracy and
integrity of your data. Occasionally, however, hardware failures, power
surges, and other problems might require you to recover your data. The
following information will help you quickly recover your data.

To recover data, you must first determine the table or tables where the
issue occurred, then determine the appropriate procedures to complete. For
more information on determining the location of tables that need
maintenance, see *Finding which tables require maintenance* on page 92.

*It's very important that the data recovery functions be performed carefully
by an authorized user. Refer to your System Setup documentation (Help \>\>
Contents \>\> select Setting Up the System) for information about setting up
security to determine users with access to these functions.*

The data recovery information contains the following sections:

- *Recovering data*

- *Checking links*

- *Reconciling tables*

- *Restoring backups*

- *Restoring data*

#### Recovering data

When you've determined the table or tables that are causing the problem,
follow the steps in this checklist. If it's possible that one or more tables
are need maintenance, but you can't determine which, perform the data
recovery procedures on all tables that may be affected.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*If you have a current backup that you made before your table issues
occurred, you could restore it instead of completing the procedures in the
recovering data checklist. The more recent your backup is, the fewer
transactions you'll need to reenter.*

**To recover data:**

1. Make a backup.

Always be sure you have a current backup of your company's data before
performing any table maintenance or utility procedures. These procedures
deal directly with the data, and if there is an interruption during
processing you will need to restore the current backup.

1. Update statistics and recompile stored procedures. Updating statistics reconfigures table keys and results in better performance; recompiling stored procedures adapts stored procedures to tables with significant increases or decreases in data. For more information, see [Updating statistics](#updating-statistics) and [Recompiling stored procedures](#recompiling-stored-procedures).

2. Check links. If you rebuild a table and the report shows that some records
    were removed, check links for the table. Checking links examines the table,
    checking corresponding information in related tables and, if possible,
    changing the data to match the corresponding data in a table. For more
    information, see [Checking links](#checking-links).

If the table is in the System or Company series, do not check links.
Instead, continue to the next step: Reconcile data.

1. Reconcile data. During a reconcile, Microsoft Dynamics GP examines the data
    within different tables and checks to see whether information that is kept
    in two different tables has the same value in both. For more information,
    see [Reconciling tables](#reconciling-tables).

2. Restore a backup. If reconciling is unsuccessful, restore your most recent
    backup. The more recent your backup, the fewer transactions you'll have to
    reenter, and if you've printed or saved all of your posting journals,
    reentering the transactions can be a fairly simple process. For more
    information, see [Restoring backups](#restoring-backups) or [Restoring data](#restoring-data).

#### Checking links

Checking links examines tables, checking corresponding information in
related tables and, if possible, changing the data to match the
corresponding data in a table.

If you were alerted to damage by an alert message indicating damage to a
specific table, the name of the table won't be listed in the Check Links
window.

<!--![](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*If the table is in the System or Company series, see Reconciling tables on page
97.*

**To check links:**

1. Be sure that no one is using Microsoft Dynamics GP. To view which users are
    in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system and where, choose Administration \>\>
    Utilities \>\> System \>\> User Activity.

2. Make a backup.

Always make a backup before checking links.

1. Open the Check Links window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> Check Links)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 57.jpg)

1. Select the series containing the tables to check.

If you know the name of the table, but not the table group to which it
belongs, refer to the Table Descriptions window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu
\>\> Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions \>\> Tables).

1. Select the tables to check links for, and choose Insert.

To remove any table from the Selected Tables list, highlight the table name
and choose Remove.

1. To insert tables from another series, repeat steps 4 and 5.

2. Choose OK to check links for the selected tables and print the Check Links
    Report. Checking links is performed as a background process, which means you
    can perform other tasks while the checking is being done.

    - Microsoft Dynamics GP checks links in the selected tables.

    - The Report Destination window will appear, and you can specify where the
        Check Links Report should be printed. If you mark File, select the
        appropriate table format and enter the report file name.

    - The Check Links Report will display any information that was re-created.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*We recommend that you send the Check Links Report to the screen, and then
print it if necessary, because it may be very large. Each report can only be
printed once each time you check links, so it's a good idea to send the
report to a file as well.*

1. To determine what information to reenter, use the Table Descriptions window
    (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions \>\>
    Tables) to view information for the table you checked links for, then use a
    window that accesses the table to reenter information. Some records are
    created through processes such as posting or aging, and this information
    can't be reentered manually in a window.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*You may want to create a report using Report Writer that lists all fields
included in the table that you checked links for. This report can serve as a
valuable reference tool. For more information, refer to the Report Writer
documentation.*

1. If checking links is unsuccessful and the problems continue to occur, go to
    *Reconciling tables* on page 97.

#### Reconciling tables

You should reconcile your data when checking links didn't resolve the
problem. Reconciling compares corresponding data in different table groups
and removes any lone, or "orphan," records. For example, a report option
that was created for a report that no longer exists is an orphan record, and
would be removed.

Reconciling also checks to be sure that corresponding or identical
information stored in two different tables is the same, and if there are
discrepancies, changes the information in the table you're reconciling to
match the information in the table it's being compared with.

For example, the number of periods in your fiscal year is stored in the
Fiscal Periods Table and the Company Master Table. If you reconcile the
Fiscal Periods Table and the number of periods is different than in the
Company Master Table, the number of periods in the Fiscal Periods Table will
be changed to match the number in the Company Master Table.

Refer to the Table Descriptions window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\>
Tools \>\> Resource Descriptions \>\> Tables) for more information on table
groups and tables. Some tables can't be reconciled. If you can't reconcile
the table, restore a backup. For more information, see *Restoring backups*
on page 99 or *Restoring data* on page 99.

**To reconcile tables:**

1. Be sure that no one is using Microsoft Dynamics GP. To view which users are
    in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system and where, choose Administration \>\>
    Utilities \>\> System \>\> User Activity.

2. Make a backup.

It's very important that you back up your tables before reconciling or
performing any other table maintenance procedure.

1. Open the Reconcile window.

(Administration \>\> Utilities \>\> System \>\> Reconcile)

![A screenshot ](media/sys admin guide 58.jpg)

1. Highlight each table to be reconciled and choose Insert.

Use the All button to select all of the tables in the List to Reconcile or
use the Remove button to remove any table from the list.

1. Choose Reconcile to reconcile the selected tables and print the Reconcile
    Report.

The Report Destination window appears; specify where the reconcile report
should be printed. If you mark File, select the appropriate file format and
enter a report table location.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/37e9f1c83cd5cae0000d5c22328baf07.gif)-->

*Always send the Reconcile Report to the printer, since it can be printed
only once. It's a good idea to send the report to a file, as well, in case
of a printer malfunction.*

The reconcile report will display any information that was changed, and list
the number of records removed, if any. Use the information on the reconcile
report to determine what information to reenter.

Use the Table Descriptions window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools
\>\> Resource Descriptions \>\> Tables) to view information for a table,
then use a window that accesses that table to reenter information. Some
records are created through processes such as posting or aging, and this
information can't be reentered manually in a window.

1. If the original problem continues to occur, restore backups. For more
    information, see *Restoring backups* on page 99 or *Restoring data* on page
    99.

#### Restoring backups

Always restore the entire database containing the affected table or tables.
The information in your Microsoft Dynamics GP system is so interrelated that
it's necessary to restore the database; we recommend that you restore a
complete backup of your tables, if possible.

**To restore backups:**

1. Back up your current data.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*Always make a backup of current data before restoring an earlier backup, in
case you need to refer to it later. Your current backup may have become
damaged, or may contain the same damage currently in your Microsoft Dynamics
GP system. Making an additional backup before you restore a previous backup
will ensure that you'll be able to restore your data to its current state,
if the backup that you restore is also damaged. Don't make this backup over
a backup you have on hand.*

1. Consult your reseller or qualified installer, or the manual for your backup
    utility, for information on how to restore a backup.

2. Reenter information entered after the backup was made, because any newer
    records were erased when the backup was restored.

3. The Table Descriptions window (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\>
    Resource Descriptions \>\> Tables) contains detailed information about each
    of the tables in Microsoft Dynamics GP. This information can help you
    reenter data by providing the following:

    - The display name, technical name, physical name, and table group for
        each table

    - The reports containing information from each table. Use the reports
        listed to determine which data is missing, or as a source of the data
        you'll need to reenter. The sample reports for each module also lists
        each report and the tables from which it draws data.

    - The window used to enter information in the table. To determine the
        physical and table groups accessed by a window, use the procedures in
        the Resource Descriptions documentation.

<!--![A Screenshot](media/fd6d021a22dcaf4de997ea2a5d15efea.gif)-->

*On rare occasions, you may not be able to reenter information into every
table. Some records are created through processes such as posting or aging,
and this information can't be reentered manually in a window. If you were
unable to reenter some of your accounting information, reports using
non-editable tables, such as history tables, could be inaccurate until the
end of the year, or until the next time you clear history.*

1. If restoring a backup was unsuccessful and the original problems continue to
    occur.

#### Restoring data

Use the Restore Company window to restore data from a backup file.

![A Screenshot](media/sys admin guide 59.jpg)

*Only the system administrator can open the Restore Company window and
restore data. The Restore Company window is only available when using a
Microsoft Dynamics GP installation on the SQL Server.*

**To restore data:**

1. Open the Restore Company window.

(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> Restore)

<!--![A screenshot ](media/d500d7795a2e3508eb777ea4bbc687a4.jpg)-->

1. Select the company to restore, or select System Database to restore system
    data.

2. Select the storage location. To use the Use Microsoft Azure storage option,
    you must be using SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1 Cumulative Update 2 or
    later.

3. Enter the path and file name of the backup file to restore from.

4. If you have marked the Use Microsoft Azure storage option, enter the access
    key, URL to container, and the file name. Then, choose Verify Account to
    verify a connection to the Microsoft Azure storage location.

5. Click OK to restore data from the backup. The window will be closed and a
    message will appear when data has been restored.

### Chapter 17: Process server troubleshooting

Use this information to help solve problems that may occur when you're
installing, setting up, or using the Distributed Process Server. If the
errors continue to occur, review the installation and setup documentation,
then contact your designated technical support source.

The process server troubleshooting information includes the following
sections:

- *Process performed locally instead of remotely*

- *Process server information not appearing in Process Server Inquiry window*

- *Report errors*

- *Items to check*

- *Adjusting processing*

#### Process performed locally instead of remotely

**Situation:** A process was set up to be completed remotely; however, it
was processed locally on a client computer instead. A message stating that
the process server wasn't available didn't appear.

**Solution:** An error may have occurred in the network protocol connection
between the process server and your computer, before the process was
started. Use a "ping" application to be sure that the two computers are
connected.

If the network protocol connection is running correctly, restart the DPS
application on the process server computer.

Another possible cause of the problem is that the user initiating the
process isn't set up to process tasks remotely. Choose Home \>\> User
Preferences to open the User Preferences window and be sure the Remote
selection is marked for the Distributed Processes option.

#### Process server information not appearing in Process Server Inquiry window

**Situation:** You've entered or selected the process server you want to
view information about in the Process Server Inquiry window, but no
information is appearing in the scrolling window.

**Solution:** If you've enabled load balancing, add the "\#" symbol at the
end of the process server name in the Server ID field in the Process Server
Inquiry window. For example, if you've entered Server1 in the Server ID
field, add the "\#" symbol so the name is Server1\#. You don't have to add
the "\#" symbol for the process server in the DPS Setup window or the DPS
Server Setup window.

#### Report errors

If you're using modified reports, be sure that the client that initiated the
remote process and the process server that you sent it to are accessing the
same reports dictionary (Reports.dic). For more information, see *Chapter 9,
"Process server configuration."*

If a process includes a report, verify the report destination. For more
information, see *Setting up report destinations for remote processing* on
page 60.

Restrictions, calculated fields, additional headers and footers and field
types that are set up incorrectly can prevent a report from being printed.
Before using a process server to print a report you've modified or created,
print it locally first to be sure it can be printed without errors. You'll
be able to determine how to correct the error more easily if you print the
report locally and view the alert message than if you print it remotely and
view the information in the Process Server Activity Table. The alert
messages that appear when a report is printed locally typically contain more
information than the information recorded in the activity table when an
error occurs in a process.

#### Items to check

Use the Process Server Inquiry window to view the Process Server Activity
Table, which contains all available information about errors that have
occurred.

Be sure that all servers in each process are operating correctly, that the
DPS application is running on each one, that the process is set up to be
processed remotely in the Process Server Setup window, and that users are
set up to use DPS.

If you're using the Distributed Process Manager application (Dpm.exe), be
sure it's running, then restart each process server and client.

#### Adjusting processing

When you use load balancing, each machine that is running a process server
is automatically given a system index. The system index is a number between
1 and 1000 that indicates the relative processing power of the machine. The
smaller the system index, the faster the machine.

If you want to modify the processing load of each process server, you must
edit the system index by adding it to the Dex.ini file of each process
server. The system index will only appear in the Dex.ini file if you add it
to the file. For example, if you wanted a process server to use a system
index of 150, you would add the following setting to the Dex.ini file:

DPSSystemIndex=150

If the default system index is too high, the machine may be operating below
its potential. To increase the load given to a process server, decrease the
system index. If you want your process server machines to have an equal
balance of processing power, each machine should have the same system index.
The default system index is 100. For more information, see *[Editing defaults
files](#editing-defaults-files).

## Glossary

#### Alert message

A message that appears when inappropriate, inadequate, or unclear data or
instructions are issued, when data is not accessible, or when a confirmation
is sought. Additional information about alert messages and their causes can
be found in the TechKnowledge database on CustomerSource.

#### Background processing

With background processing, you can continue working while Microsoft
Dynamics GP posts transactions or prints reports.

#### Backup

A copy of data made to minimize the difficulty of recovering from data loss,
due to a damaged hard disk or power loss. Backups should be performed
frequently.

#### Data

Information that has been entered or selected by a user and that appears on
a computer screen and will be stored in a table when saved.

**Defaults file**

*See Dex.ini file*.

#### Dex.ini file

A file that stores preferences, startup information and application settings
specific to the current workstation.

#### Dexterity&reg; dictionary

The Microsoft Dexterity dictionary contains resources, such as fields,
tables, windows, text and reports, used by the Dexterity development system.
Microsoft Dynamics GP was created using Microsoft Dexterity, so Microsoft
Dexterity resources are required to run Microsoft Dynamics GP. The Microsoft
Dexterity dictionary also contains the resources used to run Report Writer
and the Microsoft Dynamics GP Modifier. The file name is Dex.dic.

**DPM**

*See Distributed Process Manager*.

**DPS**

*See Distributed Process Server*.

#### Dictionary

A group of resources that, when interpreted by the runtime engine, present a
complete functioning application.

#### Dictionary location ID

In a launch file, a line that indicates a set of dictionary locations. This
set of dictionary locations includes generic pathnames for the locations of
the application dictionary, forms dictionary, reports dictionary and any
integrating dictionaries. A launch file can contain several sets of
dictionary location IDs and dictionary locations. *See also Launch file*.

#### Read/write

A table access mode that indicates the table can be read from and written
to.

#### Record

A collection of data made up of one instance of each field in a table.

#### Report Writer

A tool that allows you to design and print reports in your application.

#### Reports dictionary

The dictionary that stores user-modified resources for reports. This
dictionary is created when the Report Writer is accessed for the first time.
Only copies of a dictionary's resources are stored in the reports
dictionary.

**Runtime engine**

*See Logical table*.

#### Resource descriptions

A utility that allows you to learn technical information about Microsoft
Dynamics GP fields, tables and windows. This utility allows you to learn
more about how data is stored in Microsoft Dynamics GP, including the fields
that are stored in each table, and the reports containing data from each
table.

**.SET file**

*See Launch file*.

#### Stored procedure

Queries written in SQL, then compiled and stored in a database. Stored
procedures perform server-based processing tasks, and return a status code
to the application. In parameters can be passed to stored procedures. In
addition to the status code, out parameters also can be returned.

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

A language that allows you to define, manipulate and control access to data
in a relational database.

#### Table

A collection of related records, such as transactions or accounts. All of
the information that you enter in Microsoft Dynamics GP is stored in tables.

#### Table group
