**Your current service plan does not allow access to this information.**

**To learn more about Microsoft Dynamics Service Plans review our [service plan offerings](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532453&clcid=0x409)**.

All the listed Microsoft Dynamics GP tools are free as is, any further
functionality outside of this download will be taken on a limited basis and be
considered an Advisory Service

Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Before you begin*

- *Using Validate and Import buttons*

- *Compatibility information*

### Before you begin

This section includes information and precautions that will help you use
Professional Services Tools Library more effectively.

**Making backups** Before running any tool, make a backup of the databases
that will be affected. It is important to make a backup of your Microsoft
SQL Server® data. Many of the tools will prompt users to back up their data
before being allowed to execute the command selected. Make a backup before
continuing with the tool operation. The tools that do not prompt users with
a warning message either have another type of warning or assume that the
user has taken steps to appropriately backup the data.

**Additional users** Most tools will require that you are the only user
logged into the company. If there are additional users logged into the
company you will receive an error message listing the total number of users
in the system. Make sure all users are logged out and then reopen the tool.

*If additional products are installed, all 3rd party tables should be tested
for validation.*

**Using the “sa” login** Regardless of how role-based Security is defined in
Microsoft Dynamics GP, there are certain tools that will require users to be
logged in as “sa.” These tools are:

- Toolkit

- Customer Name Modifier

- Item Number Modifier

- Item Number Combiner

- Vendor Name Modifier

- Account Modifier/Combiner

- Salesperson Modifier

- Territory Modifier

- Territory Combiner

- Company Copy

### Using Validate and Import buttons

Validate and Import buttons are available on many of the tools that modify
or combine data. These buttons allow data to be imported without having to
manually enter the information, making the tools useful to change or combine
many pieces of data.

For example, if you are want to change 1000 current item numbers to 1000 new
item numbers one at a time, you can save time by importing a two-column
spreadsheet into modifier and combiner tools.

**Preparing your spreadsheet data:**

1. Enter existing system data — such as the Vendor ID numbers or Item numbers — in the first column of data in the spreadsheet.

1. The second column of data should contain the new ID or number, as you would enter it in the appropriate field of the respective tool.

    If you are entering account numbers in your spreadsheet, be sure to include dashes.

1. Save your spreadsheet as a text file

> [!NOTE]
> The spreadsheet must be saved as a text file in Microsoft Excel (tab delimited file), to ensure that information in Microsoft Dynamics GP is updated correctly.

**Validating and importing your data:**

A typical example of the Validate and Import function functionality would be
during an Employee ID change:

![A screenshot](media/e98c1352cd449d7aa876197e6c740aea.jpg)

1. Choose the Validate button first. Select the file and choose Open to start
    the validation process.

2. A Report Destination window will appear. Select the report destination to
    view a report verifying that information is valid. If the report states that
    there is invalid data, fix the spreadsheet and go through the validation
    process again.

3. Once the Validate report lists no invalid employee ID numbers, the data is
    ready to be imported.

    If you choose the Import button, you will receive a message to choose Validate first. The Validate button ensures that the tool will run properly. In this example, the Validate button will verify that each current employee ID number exists in your system before the conversion is performed.

1. After validating your data, choose the Import button, and choose the valid
    text spreadsheet.

2. When the data is done being imported, you will receive a message stating
    that the Import function is finished.

3. Choose OK, and close the modifier or combiner tool to receive another report destination window and view the report to see the changed data.

### Security setup

You can add a Professional Services Tools Library task to an existing
security task or create a new task. Once a security task is created, you can
either add the task to an existing role ID or create a new role ID. The
instructions provided demonstrate how to create a new task, new role ID, and
apply the new role ID to a user through User Security Setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Predefined security tasks and roles are not set up in Microsoft Dynamics GP for Professional Services Tools Library. If you want to log in as a user other than “sa,” you must set up security tasks and roles specific for each desired user(s).
Regardless of how role-based security is defined in Microsoft Dynamics GP, there are multiple Professional Services Tools that require the user be logged in as “sa.” Refer to Before you begin on page 1 for information on the specific tools.
In order for a tool to execute properly and run reports as designed, all operations relating to the Reports and Files associated to the tools must be given access along with the Window Type.

Some of the options in creating a security task illustrated below can be changed depending on what type of security you need.

**Security task setup:**

1. Go to Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\>
    Security Tasks

2. Create a new Task ID. In this example, the task name PSTL is used.

## Chapter 2: Using System Tools

This chapter explains how to use the System Series Professional Services
Tools. Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using Shortcuts Copy*

- *Using Toolkit*

- *Using Menu Inquiry Utility*

- *Using Update User Date Utility*

### Using Shortcuts Copy

Use this tool to copy the Shortcuts options from one user to another user
with the click of a button. With the Shortcuts Copy tool, you don’t have to
manually set the shortcuts up for each user on the system. This is
especially useful when macros are used with a window (e.g., Purchase Order entry to always add item).

**To copy a shortcut:**

1. Enter the User ID that you want to copy the Shortcuts from in the Copy From
    User ID field.

2. Enter the User ID you want to copy the Shortcuts to in the Copy To User ID
    field.

3. Choose copy.

4. You will be prompted to make a backup of your database. Choose Continue once
    you have made a backup.

5. An alert message signals the end of the Shortcuts copy process.

> [!NOTE]
> No Report Destination window will appear after using this tool. To verify the results, simply check to see if the users specified to have the Shortcuts copied have the same Shortcuts button.

### Using Toolkit

Use Toolkit to rebuild the GL00105 table, re-create Dex Procs, rebuild
indexes, re- create tables, and check identities of tables all within
Microsoft Dynamics GP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool requires that the user be logged in as “sa.”

**To rebuild the GL00105 table:**

1. To rebuild the GL00105 table, select Rebuild GL00105 in the Toolkit Options
    group.

    ![A screenshot ](media/bc17fd7f416e464646166ee5e0818aab.jpg)

1. Choose Next.

**To re-create Microsoft SQL Objects:**

There are several options when selecting Recreate SQL Objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should have all users out of the system when re-creating any objects using this tool.

1. Select Recreate SQL Objects under the Toolkit Options heading and choose
    Next.

2. Choose the series or table you wish to change.

    ![A screenshot ](media/1f929a3c36ad3144684ead12e67491c2.jpg)

1. Choose the SQL object you want to re-create by selecting a function in the
    Maintenance Options group.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > When re-creating tables there is an additional check box, Recreate data for selected table(s). If you mark this option the table will be re-created and the data will be left intact. If you leave the option unmarked the table will be re-created and the data will be lost.

1. Choose Perform Selected Maintenance to proceed.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind when re-creating a table with data that it may take some time to re-create depending on the table size.

### Using Menu Inquiry Utility

The Menu Inquiry Utility allows you to see all of the commands on the menus,
whether they are hidden or not, and helps identify where those commands come
from (which product) and other properties of the commands.

**To display menu commands:**

1. Choose a menu group from the Menu Groups field.

    ![A screenshot ](media/c54c9c7d6757d91e394323e5e096590a.jpg)

1. Select a Command from the resulting Categories/Commands list on the right-
    hand side to display the command properties at the bottom of the Menu
    Inquiry window.

2. Checkmarks designate certain properties of the command:

    - If the Enabled box is checked, the command is enabled.

    - If the Checked box is checked, the command or option has been selected
        and activated within Microsoft Dynamics.

    - If the Visible box is checked, the command or option is visible and
        accessible.

3. To open the corresponding window for the command, click on the gears icon
    next to the Tag \# heading.

If the gear icon appears unlit or gray, this option is unavailable for the
command selected.

### Using Update User Date Utility

The Update User Date utility will automatically update the User Date in
Microsoft Dynamics GP to the next date at midnight each day. The application
will run in the background as long as Microsoft Dynamics GP is open. To
activate this tool, simply mark the second check box next to Update User
Date in the Professional Services Tools Library window.

In order for the Update User Date utility to work properly, you will need to
have SuppressDateChangeDialog=TRUE in the Dex.ini file to suppress the date
dialog that will be displayed if Microsoft Dynamics GP is left open over the
midnight hour.

## Chapter 3: Using Financial Tools

This chapter explains how to use the Financial Series Professional Services
Tools. Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using Account Modifier/Combiner*

- *Using Checkbook Modifier*

- *Using Fiscal Period Modifier*

- *Using General Ledger Master Record Triggers*

### Using Account Modifier/Combiner

You can change previous account numbers into new account numbers or combine
existing accounts with the Account Modifier/Combiner tool. This tool can
identify which one of these activities you are trying to perform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool requires that the user be logged in as “sa.”

The difference between the modifier and combiner is that both accounts
involved in the combiner portion of the utility currently exist in the
system, while the new account number in the modifier portion is introduced
as a new number to the system.

> [!NOTE]
> Please remember to run the reconcile process for all your open and historical years after using the account modifier/combiner to ensure that detail and summary records agree.

When you attempt to modify a larger set of accounts such as 150 and use the
range option, you may notice slower performance and Dynamics GP may eventually
crash. If you are modifying a lot of accounts, we would recommend you to use the
import option.

### Using the Repopulate Column List function

If you load a dictionary after the initial install of the Professional
Services Tools Library, you should re-create an internal table using the
Repopulate Column List function. If you install a product after the initial
installation of Professional Services Tools and do not mark the Repopulate
Column List check box, the new products may not be included when using this
tool. This Repopulate Column List function only has to be marked the first
time running the tool after loading a new dictionary.

![A screenshot](media/4876f57348d9d6bdc8258615e008aa21.jpg)

**Account Modifier**

You can manipulate an account number with the Account Modifier by changing a
single account number into a new account number or by changing an entire
range of accounts. All of the open and historical information can change
without any loss of data.

**To change an account number:**

1. Enter the old account number in the Account Number field.

2. Enter the new account number in the Convert To Account Number field.

3. After entering the account numbers, choose Convert to make the change
    throughout the system.

4. When the process is finished, choose OK. You will be asked if there are any
    combines to perform.

5. If you choose No, you will receive a report describing which accounts were
    modified. If you have accounts that you wish to combine, choose Yes to make
    the tool combine those accounts. When the combine process is complete, you
    will receive a prompt to reconcile your open and historical years.

6. Choose a report destination. The report will list all the account
    modifications and combinations that took place, as well as all accounts that
    were modified and combined.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running Management Reporter with Data Mart, you will need to rebuild the Data Mart after you complete the Account changer process.

**To change a range of accounts:**

1. Select the range of accounts to be changed and identify what segment of the
    account structure will change from the Field Type drop down list.

2. After the account segment has been identified, enter a new segment value and
    choose Convert. The accounts will change throughout the system.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When using the Range convert option, combines cannot be done. If any of the changes require a combine, the change will not take place. If combines are required for many accounts, use the Import option.

    This table is an example showing what would happen if segment 1 was changed from 111 to 222.

    | **Range of accounts selected** | **New account structure** |
    |--------------------------------|---------------------------|
    | 111-1111-11                    | 222-1111-11               |
    | 111-1111-12                    | 222-1111-12               |
    | 111-1111-13                    | 222-1111-13               |
    | 111-1111-14                    | 222-1111-14               |
    | 111-1111-15                    | 222-1111-15               |
    | 111-1111-16                    | 222-1111-16               |
    | 111-1111-17                    | 222-1111-17               |
    | 111-1111-18                    | 222-1111-18               |
    | 111-1111-19                    | 222-1111-18               |
    | 111-1111-20                    | 222-1111-20               |

1. When the process is finished, choose OK. You will be asked if you want to
    combine any accounts.

2. If you choose No, you will receive a report describing which accounts were
    modified. If you have accounts that you wish to combine, choose Yes to make
    the tool combine those accounts.

3. When the combine process is complete, you will receive a prompt to reconcile
    your open and historical years.

4. Choose a report destination. The report will list all the account
    modifications and combinations that took place, as well as all accounts that
    were modified and combined.

*If you are running Management Reporter with Data Mart, you will need to
rebuild the Data Mart after you complete the Account changer process.*

**Account Combiner**

Use the Account Combiner portion of this tool to combine like accounts into
one single account. You can combine account numbers in much the same way as
you change accounts.

The accounts for Due To/Due From accounts in the Intercompany Setup window
(IC40100) are not updated correctly when using the Account Modifier/Combiner
within Professional Tools Library. To workaround this you can manually select
the appropriate 'combined' account in the Intercompany setup window via 'account
lookup'.

**To combine similar accounts:**

1. Enter an existing account number in the Account Number field.

2. Enter the existing account number to which you want to combine in the
    Convert To Account Number field.

3. After entering the account numbers, select the Convert button to make the
    change throughout the system.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Account Combiner works under the assumption that both accounts have the same posting type — either Balance Sheet or Profit and Loss. You cannot combine a Balance Sheet account into a Profit and Loss account or combine a Profit and Loss account into a Balance Sheet account. The Beginning Balance entries would be invalid if you cross match a Balance Sheet account with a Profit and Loss account.

1. Choose a report destination. The report will list all the account
    modifications and combinations that took place, as well as all accounts that
    were modified and combined.

**To combine or change multiple accounts from a spreadsheet:**

1. Enter existing account numbers in the first column of data in the
    spreadsheet, as you would enter it in the Account Number field.

2. The second column of data should contain the new account numbers, as you would enter it in Convert To Account Number field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to include dashes in the account numbers.

1. Save your spreadsheet as a text file.

2. Choose Import in the Select By field.

3. Two new buttons, Validate and Modify, are now available. Choose the Validate
    button first. Select the text spreadsheet file and choose Open to start the
    validation process.

    The Validate button will verify that each current account number exists in your system before the conversion is performed.

1. Once the validation report contains no errors, choose Modify and select your
    validated text spreadsheet to change or combine accounts.

**Previewing changes in your system:**

If you want to double check for errors before making final changes to your
system, all of the account mappings that were valid in your spreadsheet are
now contained in a Microsoft SQL Server table called TACHANGE.

If you want to preview the changes that are about to occur on the system
before combining accounts, perform a select statement against the TACHANGE
table (Select\* from TACHANGE) to view the valid mappings from your spreadsheet.

If you see an error in the TACHANGE table due to a mistake in the
spreadsheet, simply make the change to your spreadsheet and import the
spreadsheet again. The old mappings from the spreadsheet will be deleted and
the new ones will be inserted into the TACHANGE table.

> [!NOTE]
> You must perform the select statement in Microsoft SQL Server before closing the Account Modifier/Combiner window.

### Checkbook Modifier

This tool allows changes in checkbook IDs to take place. You can change an
existing checkbook ID to a new checkbook ID without any loss of work, open,
or historical records. Refer to *Using Validate and Import buttons* on page
2 for information on importing data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before changing data in the company, make a backup of the company
database.

> [!NOTE]
> This tool does not support changing the month and/or day on closed years as the tool does not recalculate the ending and beginning balances. Only use the Fiscal Period Modifier to change the Year stamp back for years that are currently closed.

**To change fiscal year definitions:**

1. Choose Setup Periods to create the new fiscal year definitions and remove
    previous fiscal year definitions. When defining the new periods, be sure to
    keep all transactions associated with the same year, only change the name of
    the year. The utility does not allow transactions for a year to be split
    between different years.

2. If you have a year that was previously closed and is open under the new
    fiscal year definitions, select a year from the drop down list and choose
    Open Year. You will receive a message stating that the year selected has
    been changed to an open year.

    summary data.

4. Reconcile each history and open year from the Reconcile Financial
    Information window, located under Utilities \>\> Financial \>\> Reconcile.
    Start with the oldest history year, and work towards the most current open
    year.

5. Review the GL data. If the data is not as expected, restore the company from
    the backup.

### General Ledger Master Record Triggers

This tool allows you to create General Ledger account master records and
replicate records to another database on the same server. You can also
choose to replicate these records to some or all of your companies.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Integration Manager to import account, customer, or vendor master records to the main company database and the integration fails for any reason, any records imported to the main company database will be deleted (rolled back). However, if you have enabled master record triggers, the records will be replicated to company databases that you specify in the Replicate To DB field, and will not be rolled back. You must delete such replicated records manually.

**To create and update General Ledger account master records:**

1. In the Master DB field, choose the database where you will be creating or
    updating records.

2. In the Replicate To DB field, choose the database to which the master
    records will be copied.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To use General Ledger Master Triggers, the “Replicate To” database must have the same company account structure setup as the Master database. This information can be found using query analyzer and doing a query on the SY00300 table against each database, or in Microsoft Dynamics GP you can go to Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\>Tools \>\> Setup \>\> Company \>\> Account Format. The same number of Segments must be setup, and each Segment must be the same length.

1. Mark the Accounts option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You will not be able to mark a check box if you are not registered for that particular Master Trigger.

### Receivables Management Transaction Unapply

This tool enables you to unapply documents in the history table and
automatically move the records back to the open table even if there are
discounts and/or write- offs associated with the document. You can reapply
the records as needed. Using this tool can be a good alternative to removing
history and reentering data if records were applied incorrectly.

> [!NOTE]
> If a discount and/or write-offs exist, a General Ledger journal transaction will be created using the original distributions of the document and the transaction will be in a batch in the General Ledger. An edit list can be printed prior to posting into the General Ledger.

    ![A screenshot](media/dab50933fff5188b269046bb2537650a.jpg)

1. The new Customer Item Lookup window is now available from the SOP Entry and
    the SOP Item Detail windows. You can open the lookup window by pressing CTRL
    H or by choosing Additional \>\> Customer Item Lookup.

The window displays the historical purchasing information for this customer
and the most recent price for each item purchased. By highlighting a record,
you can zoom back to the SOP Document Inquiry window. As Invoice documents
are posted, new entries are added to the table that stores the Customer Item
historical data.

![A screenshot](media/e9ee2a1d4204acac692f5431d54349d6.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> If a customer purchases the same item in two different unit of measure codes, both records will show in the Customer Item Lookup window. However, the unit of measure and price that will appear is based off of the item's default unit of measure. If the unit of measure changes within a sales document, a new price will become the default.

### Territory Modifier

This tool allows changes in territory IDs to take place and the process
mirrors that of how account numbers are changed. The user is able to change
an existing territory id to a new territory id without any loss of work,
open, or historical records. Just by clicking the convert button the records
are updated. If you want to import large amounts of data, refer to *Using
Validate and Import buttons* on page 2, where there is information on how to
import data.

> [!IMPORTANT]

A message signals the end of the Territory Combine process.

### SOP PO Number Check

Use the SOP PO Number Check to verify the Customer PO Number field for
duplicates as data is entered into the field on both the SOP Entry window
and the SOP Customer Detail Entry window.

**SOP PO Number Check setup:**

1. To set up the SOP PO Number Check, mark the SOP PO Number Check check box in
    the Professional Services Tools Library window. Click Next to open the Setup
    window.

    ![A screenshot](media/6346596ff60bc29163e079652ac6dc27.jpg)

1. Set the Check DB column for each SOP Type. When marked, the SQL database
    will be examined documents of the specified type that have duplicate
    Customer PO numbers. For instance, it might not matter that a duplicate
    Customer PO Number was entered on a Quote document. In that case, you would
    not mark the Check DB column for Quote documents, and the check would not be
    performed.

2. Set the Which Tables column for each SOP Type. This column specifies which
    types of tables should be searched. Choose Work, History, or Both. The
    default is Both.

3. Set the Check on UI column for each SOP Type. This field is to determine
    from the User Interface whether or not duplicate Customer PO Numbers should
    be checked. For instance, on a return you might not want to check for
    duplicate Customer PO Numbers because the customer could have multiple
    returns for a single Customer PO Number.

4. Set the Required column for each SOP Type. This will make the Customer PO
    Number field in Sales Transaction Entry a required field. Like most required
    fields, the user can delay entering this data but the Sales Document won't
    be saved until a value is entered.

5. Set the Warning Type column for each SOP Type. This specifies what the
    system should do if a duplicate PO number is found for a customer. The
    following are the available actions:

**Do Nothing** Don't give any message or warning.

**Warn Only** Presents the user with the message defined in the Message
column for that SOP Type. Only an “OK” button is displayed in the message,
because it is only a warning.

**Warn and Ask** If a duplicate is found, the message defined in the Message
column for that SOP Type will be displayed. The user will be given a choice
of “Yes” or “No”, or “Display”. If “Yes” is clicked, the Customer PO Number
is accepted. If “No” is clicked, then the user must re-enter a different
Customer PO Number. If “Display” is clicked, a window will open that shows
the records that the PO Number was found on.

**Warn and Reject** Presents the user with the message defined in the
Message column for that SOP Type. An “OK” button and a “Display” button are
displayed with the message. If “OK” is clicked, the focus will return to the
Customer PO Number and they user would have to enter a different number (or
leave it blank). If “Display” is clicked, a window will open that shows the
records that the PO Number was found on.

**Warn and Password** Presents the user with the message defined in the
Message column for that SOP Type, but will give the user the option of
entering the password entered in the Password column as an override.

1. Set the Message column for each SOP Type. This field is a user-defined
    message that is displayed after a duplicate PO Number is found. The tokens
    %1, %2, and %3 can be used in the message text, and will be substituted with
    the actual PO Number, Document Type (the words Order, Invoice, etc.), and
    SOP Number.

2. Set the Password column for each SOP Type. This field is per document type
    and is only used when the Warning Type column is set to Warn and Password.

3. Activate the utility. To activate SOP PO Number Check, simply mark the
    second check box next to SOP PO Number Check in the Professional Services
    Tools Library window.

**To use SOP PO Number Check:**

When in Sales Transaction Entry, entering in a duplicate Customer PO Number
will check for duplicates on the document types marked and apply the rules
for the document type currently entered. For any Warning Type other than Do
Nothing, a dialog will be displayed giving the custom message if a duplicate
is found. Depending on the option selected (Warn and Ask, Warn and Reject,
etc.), you will want to change the wording of the message to match more
closely with the options presented.

For this document, the setting was Warn and Ask. Clicking “Yes” would allow
reuse of the number, while clicking “No” would restart the field. Clicking
“Display” will open a display window to display the documents that the PO
Number was used on.

Drilling back on the SOP Number will open the document in SOP Inquiry.

**To set up customer exceptions:**

While each SOP Document Type can be made required by using the Customer PO
Validation Setup window, some customers might be an exception to that rule.
To create Customer Exceptions, use the Customer Exception window.

1. Choose Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\>
    Customer Exception to open this window. This window displays all of the
    customers in the system and allows you to choose the exceptions.

2. Mark the customers for which the Customer PO Number is not required. In the
    illustration above, the customer AARONFIT0001 will never have the Customer
    PO Number field marked as required, even though it was marked required in
    the Customer PO Validation Setup window.

    report.

### Using Item Number Combiner

Use the Item Number Combiner to combine existing item numbers. The old item
number is removed from the system after the combine process is finished. All
Work, Open, and History records are combined into the new item number. Refer
to *Using Validate and Import buttons* on page 2 for information on the
Validate and Import buttons, which make it possible to import large amounts
of data.

If you are using Bill of Materials or Manufacturing with Bill Of Materials,
you can NOT combine parent objects, only child objects will be able to be
combined.

*This tool requires that the user be logged in as “sa.”*  
When combing 2 Item Numbers using Item Combiner with a valuation method of
Average the Qty and Average Cost may be incorrect. A workaround to this
would be to decrease the Qty down to 0 prior to Combining Items. 

**To combine an item number:**

1. Choose the starting item number.

2. Choose the item number to which you want to combine in the Combined Into
    Item Number field.

3. Choose Convert.

function is the same as the reconcile functions built into Microsoft
Dynamics GP with one exception: only those items that need reconciling will
be reconciled using

Professional Services Tools Library. This can increase performance if all
items don’t need to be reconciled.

**To reconcile Inventory:**

1. Choose the module you want to reconcile: Inventory.

2. Choose Reconcile to reconcile the module(s).

## Chapter 6:*Using Purchasing Tools

This chapter explains how to use the Purchasing Series Professional Services Tools. Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using 1099 Modifier*

- *Using Payables Management Master Record Triggers*

- *Using Payables Management Minimum Check*

- *Using Select Checks Combiner*

- *Using Vendor Name Modifier*

- *Using Minimum PO/Receipt Number*

- *Using POP Cost Defaulter*

### Using 1099 Modifier

This tool allows you to update the 1099 amounts for vendors who are not set
up as a 1099 vendor for the year or a portion of the year.

This tool will only modify records that are already paid and should be 1099
records for the year selected. If you have any work or open records that
haven’t been paid but were entered/posted while the vendor was not set up as
a 1099 vendor, those records will not be changed. You need to execute this
tool the next year prior to printing 1099 reports to be sure that work and
open records that were paid in the new year, get updated.

**To update 1099 amounts:**

1. Set the vendor up as a 1099 vendor by selecting that option on the Vendor
    Card.

2. Once the vendor is marked as a 1099 vendor, open the 1099 Modifier tool from
    the Professional Services Tools Library menu.

    ![A screenshot](media/0cd4ee5bc05eca0373eb73ed79a5f7e4.jpg)

1. Select whether you would like to Print Report Only or Process and Print
    Report.

The Print Report Only option shows you the Vendor, Voucher Number, and

Amount that will be converted to a 1099 amount. The Process and Print Report
option makes the changes, prints the report and prints an updated Summary
records report for the 1099 amount.

1. Select the calendar year to which you want to make the changes.

2. You will be prompted to back up your database. Choose Continue once you have
    a backup of your database. A message will signal when the 1099 Modifier has
    finished processing.

If you selected Process and Print Report, you may get an additional report
showing summary table changes that have been made to the 1099 amount field.
The number under the Amount After heading is the amount that prints on your
1099 reports.

1. Close the 1099 Modifier window. A report destination window will appear.

Choose a destination for the report to view a 1099 Modified Records report.

This report shows the specific vouchers that were changed to 1099 amounts.

### Using Payables Management Master Record Triggers

This tool allows you to add a vendor and vendor address master record and
replicate records to another database on the same server. You can also
choose to replicate these records to some or all of your companies.

*If you are using Integration Manager to import account, customer, or vendor
master records to the main company database and the integration fails for
any reason, any records imported to the main company database will be
deleted (rolled back). However, if you have enabled master record triggers,
the records will be replicated to company databases that you specify in the
Replicate To DB field, and will not be rolled back. You must delete such
replicated records manually.*

If you utilize the RM and PM Master triggers in the Professional Service Tools
Library and a customer or vendor has an address with more than 31 characters in
the field, the system will truncate any characters after 31.

**To create and update vendor and vendor address records:**

1. In the Master DB field, choose the database where you will be creating or
    updating records.

    ![A screenshot](media/c1191b26fd8c4b16fbd42dc3cfd908fd.jpg)

1. In the Replicate To DB field, choose the database to which the master records will be copied.

1. Mark the Vendors option.

    You will not be able to mark an option if you are not registered for that particular Master Trigger.

1. Close Master Triggers Setup. When you create or update a master record in
    the database you entered in the Master DB field, the record will be inserted
    or updated in the database you chose in the Replicate To DB field.

### Using Payables Management Minimum Check

Use the Payables Management Minimum Check tool to set a minimum amount for
your Payables checks within the Select Checks process.

*This process occurs after the Payment Vouchers have already been created.
This will cause a break in the payment vouchers sequence in the system but
will not harm anything.*

**Payables Management Minimum Check setup:**

1. This tool modifies existing features within Microsoft Dynamics GP. To
    activate the new functionality that this tool offers, simply mark the second
    check box next to PM Minimum Check from the Professional Services Tools
    Library menu. Close the window.

2. When opening the Select Payables Checks window, the title bar of the window
    will display the current settings for the minimum check amount.

    ![A screenshot](media/5a4c5a9e7c53c8d89a0f5fd2cdb19771.jpg)

1. To change the Minimum Check amount, choose Additional \>\> Set Minimum Check
    Amount. The Minimum Select Check Amount window will appear.

2. Enter the new minimum check amount in the Minimum Check Amount field.

You can turn the minimum check amount on or off by marking or unmarking the
Use Minimum Amount check box.

*The settings are per machine and stored in the Dex.ini for use in the next
check build process, for example MinPMCheck=201.00.*

### Using Select Checks Combiner

Use this tool to consolidate checks to match the same vendor when users are
appending to an existing checks batch. This can be useful if users
frequently build batches of Payables checks and select different document
number ranges or date ranges.

**To activate Select Checks Combiner:**

1. This tool modifies existing features within Microsoft Dynamics GP. To
    activate the new functionality that this tool offers, simply mark the second
    check box next to Select Checks Combiner from the Professional Services
    Tools Library menu. Close the window.

2. If a check exists for a vendor when checks are rebuilt, new amounts will be
    added to the existing check — instead of issuing multiple checks. This only
    applies if the One Check Per field is set to Vendor in the Select Payables
    Checks window.

### Using Vendor Name Modifier

Use this tool to change the Vendor Name. You can change an existing vendor
name to a new vendor name without any loss of work, open, or historical
records.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool requires that the user be logged in as “sa.”

**To change a vendor name:**

1. In the Starting Vendor Number field, enter the name that you want to modify.
    The existing Starting Vendor Name will automatically appear.

2. In the Ending Vendor Name field, enter the name you want to change to.
    choose Convert to update records. Refer to Using the *Using Validate and
    Import buttons* for information on importing data.

    ![A screenshot ](media/c14af4a366e6717fcfb00e3387148407.jpg)

1. You will be prompted to back up your database. Choose Continue once you have
    a backup of the database. A message will signal the end of the vendor name
    change.

2. Choose OK and close the Vendor Name Modifier window.

A report destination window will appear. Choose a destination for the report
to view a Vendor Descriptions Modified report.

### Using Minimum PO/Receipt Number

This tool adds the ability to prevent Purchase Order Processing from
defaulting to the next PO Number or Receipt Number. You can set the default
to a number before the current PO number when a previously existing PO
number is deleted. You can also set the minimum PO Number default, so
defaults will never go below the set amount.

**To set a Minimum PO or Receipt number:**

1. To activate the new functionality that this tool offers, simply mark the
    second check box next to Minimum PO/Receipt \# from the Professional
    Services Tools menu. Close the window.

2. Open Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> Purchasing \>\>
    Purchase Order Processing, and then choose Additional \>\> Minimum PO
    Number.

3. Enter the minimum purchase order and receipt numbers.

4. If you do not want to use previous PO or receipt numbers, select the check
    box to never default to a previous PO or receipt number.

The Minimum PO Number Default and Minimum Receipt Number Default fields will
be disabled.

1. Choose Save.

*This functionality will only work for document numbers that are the same
length. If the next PO Number field is not the same length as the Minimum PO
Number entered, then the system will function as it did without the
customization.*

### Using POP Cost Defaulter

Use this tool to specify the default cost for a purchase order document. To
set up the POP Cost Defaulter, select POP Cost Defaulter in the Professional
Services Tools Library and click Next.

In the POP Cost Defaulter window, select what cost you would like to default
from the item in the PO Entry window. Typically, the Last Invoice Cost is
defaulted from Cards \>\> Inventory \>\> Vendors. Once POP Cost Defaulter is
activated, either the Current or Standard Cost will be defaulted based on
your selection.

To activate this tool simply mark the second check box next to POP Cost
Defaulter in the Professional Services Tools Library window.

## Chapter 7: Using Payroll Tools

This chapter explains how to use the Payroll Series Professional Services Tools. Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using Employee Modifier*

- *Using the Certified Payroll Report*

### Using Employee Modifier

This tool allows the user to change an existing employee ID to a new
employee ID without losing any work, open, or history records. If you plan
to import large amounts of data, refer to *Using Validate and Import
buttons* on page 2 to use the Validate and Import buttons.

**To change an employee ID:**

1. Enter the Starting Employee ID.

    ![A screenshot](media/e98c1352cd449d7aa876197e6c740aea.jpg)

1. Enter the new Employee ID.

2. Choose Convert. You will be prompted to back up your database. Once a

backup is made of the database, Choose Continue.

1. A message will appear when the employee ID change is finished.

2. Choose OK and close the Employee Change window. A Report Destination window
    will appear. Choose a destination to view the Converted Employee IDs report.

### Using the Certified Payroll Report

Use the Certified Payroll Report with US Payroll to add a project number to
employees’ hourly transactions and track them on a per project basis. This
tool will also capture information posted from the Timesheet Entry window in
Project Accounting Timesheet Entry. You can print these transactions on a
weekly report and view employees, departments, job titles, and pay codes by
project.

**Certified Payroll Report setup:**

1. This tool modifies existing features within Microsoft Dynamics GP. To
    activate the new functionality that this tool offers, simply mark the second
    check box next to Certified Payroll Report in the Professional Services
    Tools menu. Close the window.

2. Open the Alternate/Modified Forms and Reports window by choosing Microsoft
    Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Alternate/ Modified
    Forms and Reports.

    ![A screenshot](media/f6cd48c209fdd7cacf54e6965ea45cab.jpg)

1. Select the ID for which you want to view the Certified Payroll Report.

2. Select Technical Service Tools from the Product drop-down list.

3. Select Windows for the Type drop-down list.

4. Expand the + beside the Payroll folder.

5. Expand the + beside Payroll Transaction Entry.

6. You should now see an option for Microsoft Dynamics GP or Technical Service
    Tools. Select Technical Service Tools.

7. Click Save on the form.

1. To create a shortcut, right-click in the Home menu and select Add \>\> Add
    Window.

2. Open Technical Service Tools \>\> Payroll and select the Certified Payroll
    Report Option.

3. Choose Done and select Yes to save the changes.

**To use Payroll Transaction Entry:**

To use the Certified Payroll functionality, simply enter a Job Number while
entering Payroll transactions.

![A screenshot ](media/14d96c71a001e5f12450c7f34eca1f74.jpg)

The Job Number field is located in the expanded area of the Payroll
Transaction Entry window. This field is only active for transactions that
are Hourly, Overtime or

Double Time payroll types, and will be disabled for any other types of
transactions.

There is no validation for the Job Number itself, and the Job Number can be
any string of 15 characters or less.

Once a batch is posted along with a check run, the information about the
transaction is stored to be printed later on the Certified Payroll Report.
The report includes the Employee ID, Job Number, Job Title, Department, Pay
Code, number of hours, and the Pay Rate for this check. This information
will remain in the system for as long as the user keeps Check History for
the employee.

**To print the Certified Payroll Report:**

Once transactions have been posted with information about the Job Number,
users can access the Certified Payroll Report from whichever palette was
chosen during setup. Typically, this would be the Payroll Transactions
palette.

1. Open the Certified Payroll Report window.

    ![A screenshot ](media/0e6852a93880e5b59c05b21cc5ee6cac.jpg)

1. Mark All jobs or enter a range of jobs.

2. Choose the Ending Date of the 7-day period to be printed on the report. All
    transactions for the week that ends on the date specified and meets the
    range of Job Numbers will print on the report.

3. Mark Print Report Headings to manually enter the Contract and Contractor
    information.

4. Mark Print Signature Paragraph to print a paragraph on your report stating
    your certification that the payroll is correct and complete and the wage
    rates are valid according to the Secretary of Labor.

5. Choose Print to print the report. The information that prints on the report
    is summarized for each employee within each job. Each employee could have
    several line items for a single job if the employee used different pay
    codes, job titles or departments during the week period. Each employee could
    have different line items on more than one job report if the employee worked
    on more than one job during the week period. A summary total of the
    employee's total weekly hours for the Job and their total Job Gross Pay is
    printed for each employee on every job report.

*The employee's total weekly gross and net pay, along with their total FICA,
federal, state and other withholding is given on the report as summary
information. Keep in mind that these summary figures may contain amounts
that may have been allocated to other jobs during the week or may have come
from a pay code that does not allow job number entry, such as sick or
vacation time.*

The report also contains a summary for an entire job that describes the
total job- specific gross pay along with the total overall gross pay for all
employees who worked on that job during the week. Each separate Job will
reset the report to start over with page 1.

## Chapter 8: Using Miscellaneous Tools

This chapter explains how to use Professional Services Tools that are not associated with a particular series. Information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using Fixed Asset Modifier*

- *Using Default Add Item POP/SOP*

- *Using Doc Date Verify*

- *Using Decimal Place Tool*

- *Using Company Copy*

### Using Fixed Asset Modifier

Use this tool to reclassify an asset code within the Fixed Assets module.
All tables throughout the system will reflect this change.

**To reclassify an asset code:**

1. Enter the existing Asset ID.

    ![A screenshot](media/522477c75245b10318d8f5a971306177.jpg)

1. Enter the new Asset ID value. Choose Change. The Fixed Assets Modifier tool will update the following tables with the new ID:

- FA00100 • FA00700 • FA00701 • FA00800 • FA00801

- FA01002

- FA01100

- FA01300

- FA10200

### Using Default Add Item POP/SOP

When activated, Default Add Item will automatically mark the Add Item
selection in the Options menu for the following windows:

- Sales Transaction Entry

- Purchase Order Entry

- Receivings Transaction Entry

- Purchasing Invoice Entry

The Add Item selection can be marked or unmarked normally after Default Add
Item is activated. However, it will default to marked instead of unmarked.

To activate this tool, simply mark the second check box next to Default Add
Item POP/SOP in the Professional Services Tools Library window.

### Using Doc Date Verify

When Doc Date Verify is activated, and a document date is entered, a check
will be performed to determine whether the document date is in a valid
fiscal period or if the fiscal period is closed.

- If the date does not fall within a valid fiscal period, a message will be
    displayed and the user will not be allowed to continue until the date is in
    a valid period.

- If the Document Date falls within a period that is closed, a message will be
    displayed that will allow the user to correct the date or continue on
    leaving the date.

This functionality is available in the following windows:

- Payables Transaction Entry

- Receivables Transaction Entry

- Invoice Entry

- Payables Manual Payment Entry

- Sales Transaction Entry

- Inventory Transaction Entry

- Cash Receipts Entry

- Purchase Order Entry

- Receivings Transaction Entry

- Purchasing Invoice Entry

To activate this tool, simply mark the second check box next to Doc Date
Verify in the Professional Services Tools Library window.

### Using Decimal Place Tool

When the Decimal Place tool is activated, both Payables Management checks
and Payroll checks will have the Check Amount in Words truncated to two
decimals. This tool would be used if the currencies in Microsoft Dynamics GP
were changed to more than two decimals. In this situation, the checks will
print with more than two decimals, which can alter the amount of the check.
The Decimal Place tool will adjust the Check Amount in Words portion to two
decimal places.

*The Decimal Places Tool will change only the Check Amount in Words portion
of the check. To change the actual amount on the check to match the Check
Amount in Words, you must use Report Writer to modify the check report and
change the currency fields to only print two decimal places. Modifying the
Check Amount in Words is not possible in Report Writer, so this tool allows
that portion of the change.*

To activate this tool, simply mark the second check box next to Decimal
Place Tool in the Professional Services Tools Library window.

### Using Company Copy

This tool allows the setup and report option information from one company to
be copied to another company within Microsoft Dynamics GP. You can choose
the modules for which information will be copied from the source company to
the destination company.

*This tool requires that the user be logged in as “sa.”*

Before using the Company Copy tool, be aware of the following important
issues:

- You should use this tool only after creating a SQL database backup of the
    destination company. The copy operation is irreversible without a backup.

- When the copy process is run, the setup tables and report options tables in
    the modules you selected will be deleted for the destination company. If you
    have manually added setup or report option information for a module in the
    destination company, and you do not want this information deleted, do not
    use the Company Copy tool to copy data for that module.

- You should be the only user who is logged into Microsoft Dynamics GP when
    the operation is performed.

- The operation can take a significant amount of time to complete, so you
    should consider performing it during off-peak hours.

**To copy company setup:**

1. Select the source company and the destination company.

    ![A screenshot ](media/577c501cb87929fc73ecf070d08df050.jpg)

1. Indicate what information you want to copy to the destination company. You
    can copy setup data, report options, or both. You must mark at least one of
    the options.

2. Select the modules for which you want information to be copied. If you mark
    All Modules, all of the modules listed will be marked. Be aware of these
    guidelines:

    - If Report Options is selected, Company must be marked.

    - When the Data or Report Options are selected, Financial must be marked
        due to the account index dependency with other modules.

The following dependencies exist for the modules:

- If Manufacturing is marked, Inventory must also be marked.

- If Extended Pricing is marked, Inventory and Receivables must also be
    marked.

- If Project Accounting is marked, Inventory, Receivables, and Payroll must

also be marked.

- If Bill of Materials is marked, Inventory must also be marked.

1. Click Process to begin processing. A processing status message will be
    displayed in the lower-left corner of the Company Copy window. The
    processing time required will depend on the amount of data in the modules
    selected. When processing has finished, a status message will indicate that
    processing is complete.

2. Log into the destination company to validate the setup information and
    report option information that you copied.
