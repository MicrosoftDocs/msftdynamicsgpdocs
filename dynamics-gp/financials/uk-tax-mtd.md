# VAT in the UK Version of Microsoft Dynamics GP

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is implementing the first step of Making Tax Digital, which imposes new requirements on VAT registered businesses above the VAT threshold. Requirements will be implemented in phases. In the first phase, with a deadline in April, 2019, the following requirements will take effect:

* Keeping records digitally - Businesses must now keep all their records digitally. For users of ERP systems this will not have any impact since they already keep their records digitally in these systems.  
* Submit VAT return electronically using [software recognized by HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-for-sending-income-tax-updates).
* If you are new to VAT 100 setup, review [How to set up VAT 100 Return](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=640f40e6-15d2-425f-b174-6868ea17e76b)
* If you are having issues using the Making Tax Digital, see [Troubleshooting Making Tax Digital]( https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp/archive/2019/03/12/microsoft-dynamics-gp-39-making-tax-digital-39-functionality-for-uk-vat)
* Group VAT functionality added to Microsoft Dynamics GP. For more information, see [Group VAT filing for multiple companies with VAT 100 Return](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp/posts/microsoft-dynamics-gp-group-vat-filing-for-multiple-companies-with-vat-100-return)

## Set up Making Tax Digital for VAT

The Making Tax Digital feature uses a service connection to communicate with HMRC.

In the **Company Setup** window, you must specify your company's tax registration number.

In the **UK Digital VAT Setup** window (Cards -> Company-UK Electronic VAT Setup), you must specify that you want to use the Making Tax Digital service.

### Set up VAT returns

HMRC maintains a list of VAT obligations for companies, which are the periods for which they must report VAT and the due date for the report. HMRC exposes this information through their API so that Dynamics GP can retrieve the obligations. Dynamics GP stores VAT obligations as **VAT Return Periods**, and uses them to:

* Remind you about VAT returns that are due or overdue.  
* Automatically enter start and end dates when you create VAT returns.  

In order to use the Making Tax Digital service, you must connect to the service from the **VAT Return** window.
(Tools -> Routines -> Company -> Vat Return)
The window information  and verbiage will changed based on if you mark Use UK VAT Making Tax Digital in the above step.

To enable the connection, you must create a new VAT return.

#### To connect to the Making Tax Digital service

1. In the **VAT Return** window, enter a VAT Report ID, and then enter a year (this is the year that your VAT tax obligation is due).

2. Once you tab off the **Year** field, the **HMRC Log in** window appears where you can login to the HMRC site.

> [!NOTE]
> After submitting the return, if the progress window does not start and there is no response window, it could be a proxy server issue. For more information, see [https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#network-access](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#network-access)  

> [!NOTE]
> The above Making Tax Digital process of submitting to the HMRC also works for the VAT Daybook module in Dynamics GP. VAT Daybook does not allow you to edit the amounts prior to submission like you can in the VAT 100 (return) window.

> [!NOTE]
> The VAT Return is mainly pulling from the TX30000 table.  The VAT Return also uses the DOCDATE, not the Tax_Date.  We typically do not see users changing the Tax_Date to be something different than the document date.  If yours appear different, this may cause your summary and detail reports to be off/different.
