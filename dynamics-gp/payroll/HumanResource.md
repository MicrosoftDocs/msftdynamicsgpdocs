# Human Resources in Microsoft Dynamics GP

You can use Human Resources to set up, enter, and maintain most of your employee  management needs and to track organizational details and personal information for employees within your company. You also can use Human Resources to view important information about employees, their benefits, and other historical data.

You also can use Human Resources to complete the following tasks:

- Manage the interviewing and hiring of applicants, track the termination, training, and evaluation of employees, and maintain organizational details, such as the supervisor, position, and department assignment of employees

- Create company benefit plans—complete with employee and employer deduction provisions, enroll employees and their dependents in benefits, and calculate the benefit value

- Enter employee attendance information, including creating attendance transactions and tracking planned absences for employees

- Define vacation and other time accruals tracked in your organization and how employees can earn time accruals, then set up schedules to show how employees can earn the time accruals at various rates

- Monitor the distribution of company property, such as laptop computers and cell phones, to employees

If you are using U.S. Payroll, you can enter and maintain your employee information in Human Resources and those transactions automatically will update your payroll records.

In this article, we describe the system setup and how to define Human Resources preferences. For information about how to configure the company, see [Human Resources - Company Setup](human-resources-company-setup.md).  

If you are setting up Human Resources in the absence of Payroll, after setup you must modify user security settings to enable user access to Human Resources
functionality.  

## Human Resources preferences

You can specify default employee numbers for your organization by entering an employee ID in the Human Resources Setup window.  

You can choose to have Human Resources automatically assign employee IDs and increase the employee ID number by one for each new record in the Employee Maintenance window.

You can customize the way Human Resources works for your organization by specifying preferences in the Human Resources Preferences window. The user preferences you select will be applied to all the companies within your organization. You also can set up user access to employee information by divisions and departments.

Use the Human Resources User Preferences window to indicate which window should be displayed when you start Human Resources and choose to display employee information by descriptions or codes in the Employee Maintenance window.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Setting up an employee number*

- *Setting up Human Resources preferences*

- *Setting up user access to employee information*

- *Copying user access to employee information*

- *Setting up Human Resources user preferences*

## Setting up an employee number

Use the Human Resources Setup window to assign default employee IDs automatically. Each time you add a new employee in the Employee Maintenance
window, the default number will increase by one to the next available number as each number is accepted.

If you are registered for Payroll, the same settings in the Payroll Setup window will be updated with your settings in the Human Resources Setup window.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Dynamics GP on a network where more than one person is entering new employee records at the same time, the default number might appear to increase by two or more.

### To set up an employee number

1. Open the Human Resources Setup window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> Human Resources \>\> Human Resources)

2. Mark the Auto Assign Employee ID option to assign an employee ID for each new employee record.

3. Enter the next employee ID that will be displayed when you add a new employee record in the Employee Maintenance window.

4. Choose OK to save your changes.

## Setting up Human Resources preferences

Use the Human Resources Preferences window to set up Human Resources preferences for your organization.

### To set up Human Resources preferences

1. Open the Human Resources Preferences window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Human Resources Preferences)

    ![the Human Resources Preferences window](media/HRPREF.jpg)

2. Mark options for seniority dates and address changes.

    The following table describes each option.

    | **HR preference option** | **How to use this option** |
    |--|--|
    | Update seniority date with adjusted hire date | Mark to use an employee's adjusted hire date as the seniority date for calculating accruals, such as vacation and sick time. |
    | Adjusted hire date for benefits | Mark to use an employee's adjusted hire date to determine eligibility for benefits, such as health insurance and 401(k) enrollment dates. |
    | Adjusted hire date for length of service | Mark to use an employee's adjusted hire date to determine length of service on the Employee Service by Hire Date report. |
    | Address change report | Mark to track an employee's previous address. |

    Changes to the adjusted hire date in the Employee Maintenance window will update the seniority date in the Employee Attendance Maintenance window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > An adjusted hire date is a hire date that has been changed to reflect time away from the job. For example, suppose an employee leaves your company but is hired again by your company six months later. You can create an adjusted hire date that is six months after his first hire date, which is then used to determine his benefit time and benefit eligibility.

3. Mark the Purge Applicants option to automatically delete applicant records at defined intervals.

    Enter the number of days that the applicant records should remain in the system before being deleted. The Last purge date field displays the date when applicant records were last deleted.

## Organizational structure
Your company’s organizational structure might include multiple levels, such as divisions, departments, positions, supervisors, and locations. You can create these levels and store additional information for each level.

A division is a branch of a company, usually including several departments. A department is a specialized portion of a division or company, which usually concentrates on one type of task. You’ll use several windows to enter the various types of organizational information for your business. Some companies conduct business from more than one site or location and each site has a different address.

Each position has certain physical requirements. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities. Use the Position Setup window to enter employee positions, and use the ADA Physical Requirements window to define the physical requirements for each position.

Many positions require special skills and training and you can link training courses and classes to position codes. You can use the Position Course Link window and the Courses Available to Link window to link skill and training requirements to position codes.

You can use position control to plan future positions and roll down information from the planned positions and position seats to employees. Position control is optional.

### Understanding pay steps
Before you can begin using the pay steps feature, you need to activate it in the Human Resources Preferences window. 
(Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> System >> Human Resources Preferences)

The pay steps feature integrates with U.S. Payroll, but is not available with Canadian Payroll.

You can use pay steps to associate an employee’s amount of time in a position with a rate of pay. A pay step table lists pay steps (or grades) by number, the assigned duration of each step, and the dollar amounts for each step under successive effective dates.

For example, after an employee has served in a position for the full duration of a pay step, the employee advances to the next pay step and its corresponding pay rate under the current effective date. When the next effective date arrives, the employee advances to the new pay rate for the current pay step.

When you assign an employee and an associated pay code to a pay step table (in the Employee/Pay Step Table Entry window or the Employee Pay Code Maintenance window), you can base the step increases on the employee’s hire date, adjusted hire date, seniority date, or a manually entered date.

The Payroll system creates post-dated pay rates for the future increases indicated in the pay steps table. A reminder on your Microsoft Dynamics GP home page lists employee post-dated pay rates eligible for activation. After you activate an employee’s post-dated pay rate, it becomes effective, on the designated date, for all future pay periods.

You can use multiple pay step tables to associate pay rates with other employee qualifications, such as education, in addition to time in a position. For example, if you base employee pay rates, in part, on education level, you can create a pay step table for “Bachelor’s Degree” and another for “Master’s Degree.”

You can use multiple pay step tables to associate pay rates with other employee qualifications, such as education, in addition to time in a position. For example, if you base employee pay rates, in part, on education level, you can create a pay step table for “Bachelor’s Degree” and another for “Master’s Degree.”

> We recommend three years of accrual periods or pay periods are set up: 
> The previous year
> The current year
> The upcoming year
> This is something you will want to update as you start to Accrue in a new year, example January or after year end close.

**Setting up accruals**

Use the Accrual Setup window to create accruals that determine the rate at which benefit time, such as vacation time or sick time, is earned. An accrual is how an employee earns benefit time. Time codes indicate what is earned and accruals indicate how that time is earned. 

For example, suppose that employees earn 24 hours of vacation time after they work six months. After they work 12 months, they earn another 40 hours of vacation time, and after working two to five years, they earn 80 hours of vacation time. Each of these accruals can be added to an accrual schedule.

To use the Accrual Setup window, you must have marked Human Resources as the accrue type in the Attendance Setup window.

To set up accruals:
1.	Open the Accrual Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Accruals)
2.	Enter or select an accrual code and description.
3.	Select an option in the Accrue By field, such as Pay Period, to accrue benefit time.
4.	If you selected Post Once, Interval, or Pay Period in the Accrue By field, enter the number of hours to accrue.
5.	If you selected Interval in the Accrue By field, enter the number of days per interval.
6.	Enter the maximum accrual hours per year that an employee can earn.
7.	Enter the maximum hours available that an employee can have at any given time for the accrual you selected.
8.	If you selected Hour/Yr in the Accrue By field, enter the standard work hours per year an employee works in the Work Hours per Year field. 
9.	If you selected Pay Period in the Accrue By field, select the frequency that the accrual happens in the Accrual Period field.
10.	If you selected Hour/Yr in the Accrue By field, select one or more time codes in the Based on Time Codes list to base the accrual on. Transactions for these time codes will be used to calculate benefit hours earned.
Choose Mark All to mark all the time codes in the list, or choose Unmark All to unmark all the time codes in the list and choose Save.

There are 4 types of Accruals you can set up on HR:   
(Go to Microsoft Dynamics GP | Tools | Setup | Human Resources | Attendance | Accruals and refer to the ACCRUE BY field.)

1. POST ONCE -  The 'Number of Hours to Accrue' amount will be awarded ONE TIME only and stop.

2. INTERVAL -  The 'Number of Hours to Accrue' amount will be awarded repeatedly for each interval set, defined by the fixed 'Number Of Days per Interval' set.  For monthly, set to 30, for yearly, set to 365, etc. 

3. HOUR/YR - This is the 'Hours Worked' accrual and will be awarded based on transactions keyed (so is typically used for Hourly employees).  With this type, the 'Based on Time Codes' section will become available and you can mark which Time Codes should be accrued on.   The transactions must exist in the HR transaction table (TATX1030) BEFORE the Accrual process is run.  Once the transactions are accrued on, they are marked off in the table so they are not accrued on again.  This type is most common for hourly employees.  For the Hours/Yr accrual type, the amount accrued per hour/unit will equal the YEAR MAX / Hour per Year base (fields in the Accrual Setup window):  

Hours Accrued =  'Maximum Accrual Hours Per Year' / 'Work Hours Per Year'

Example:  If you wanted the employee to earn '4' Accrual hours for every 40 hours worked, and they can only earn a maximum of '80' accrual hours per calendar year, then you would use the equation above to figure out what to enter for the 'Work Hours Per Year' field on the Accrual setup.   In the Accrual Setup, the 'Maximum Accrual Hours per year' would be 80 according to our example, and the 'Work Hours Per Year' would be calculated out to be '800'.  Enter 800 in this field in the Accrual setup window.   So 80/800 = .01 hours per unit, and .01 x 40 total hrs = 4 hours earned.     

Here is how we back into our accrual amount
If you are going to user Human Resources
 
We need to figure out the accrual rate per hour worked as I think that is how we should accrue this.

Hours worked * Vacation/sick hours per year / 2080 = accrue amount.

For an example, I worked 20 hours you would need to back into it as follows (20 * 48 / 2080 = .46).
I worked 30 hours you would need to back into it as follows (30 * 48 / 2080 = .69
I worked 60 hours you would need to back into it as follows (60* 48 / 2080 = 1.39

For example, when you setup the accrual in the Accrual Setup window you would say Accrue by Hours/Yr and select 48 in the Maximum Accrual Hours per Year field and then 2080 in work hours per year

> [!TIP]
> If you import transactions to payroll, usually that does not update Human Resource information (TATX1030).  Then your hours worked accruals will not work.  This could happen if you are using Integration Manager or eConnect.  Once you have completed the import go to Tool | Utilites | Human Resource and Reconcile to update HR information from the payroll batch.

NOTE:  Keep in mind that salaried employees typically do not have transactions created in the TATX1030 table so the Hrs/Yr type is typically not used for salaried employees.     

4. PAY PERIOD -  The type will simply award a 'fixed amount' per pay period.  This type is most commonly used for salaried employees.


**Modifying or deleting an accrual**

Use the Accrual Setup window to modify or delete an accrual. You can modify an accrual to reflect changes, such as an increase in the maximum number of hours that can be earned.

To modify or delete an accrual:
1.	Open the Accrual Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Accruals)
2.	Enter or select an accrual.
3.	To modify the accrual, make your changes and choose Save.
4.	To delete the accrual, choose Delete.

**Setting up an accrual schedule**

After you’ve defined the benefit times tracked in your organization and how employees can earn those different types of benefit times, you can set up accrual schedules to show how employees can earn benefit times at various rates. For more information, refer to Setting up accruals on page 58.
Use the Accrual Schedule Setup window to create tiered structures that define how employees earn benefit time based on seniority.

Before you set up accrual schedules, you must indicate whether seniority is based on months or days in the Attendance Setup window. For more information, refer to Setting up attendance on page 55. 

To set up an accrual schedule:
1.	Open the Accrual Schedule Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Accrual Schedule)
2.	Enter or select a schedule code and description that identifies the accrual schedule.
3.	Enter the starting date and ending date for the accrual schedule. If it’s a continuous accrual schedule, leave the End Date field blank.
4.	In the Attendance Setup window, you selected to base seniority on months or days. In the Seniority column, enter the number of months or days of seniority an employee must have to be eligible for the accrual.
5.	Enter or select an accrual code in the Accrual column. Press TAB to display information in remaining columns and choose Save

![the User Setup window 2](media/ACCRUASECH45.jpg)

**Modifying or deleting an accrual schedule**
Use the Accrual Schedule Setup window to modify or delete an accrual schedule. You can modify an accrual schedule to include changes, such as adding an accrual to an existing schedule.
To modify or delete an accrual schedule:
1.	Open the Accrual Schedule Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Accrual Schedule)
2.	Enter or select a schedule.
3.	To modify the schedule information, make your changes and choose Save.
4.	To delete schedule information, choose Delete. To delete a row of information, select the line and from the Edit menu, choose Delete Row.

**Setting up a time code**
You can set up a time code to categorize how employees use their time. For instance, time codes can be used to track vacation time, hourly time, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) time, and sick time.

Use the Time Code Setup window to create time codes and define the various ways that employees in your organization account for their time. You also can link a default accrual schedule to each time code.

If your company employs both hourly workers and salaried workers, you might need to set up separate time codes for each of the different types of time tracked, such as vacation time and sick time. For example, you might set up a vacation time code for salaried employees and a vacation time code for hourly employees. You also might set up a sick time code for salaried employees and a sick time code for hourly employees.

You can select a pay code in the Linked Pay Code field to link an attendance time code to a U.S. or Canadian Payroll pay code. When you create a transaction for a pay code that is linked to a time code, a transaction also will be created for the time code. Then, you don’t have to enter transactions in both Human Resources and U.S. or Canadian Payroll. 
To link pay codes to time codes, pay codes and pay types must match the corresponding time codes and time types. For example, if the time type is Hourly, you only can link pay codes with a pay type of Hourly. Or, if the time type is Benefit, you only can link pay codes with a pay type of Vacation, Sick Time, or Holiday.

To set up a time code:
1.	Open the Time Code Setup window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Time Code)
2.	Enter or select a time code and description to identify the time record.
3.	Select a time type that the time code is based on and select an accrual period.
4.	If the time type is Benefit, enter or select a default accrual schedule.
5.	Enter or select a code in the Linked Pay Code field to link pay codes to time codes. 

If U.S. or Canadian Payroll is registered and you selected Human Resources for the accrue type in the Attendance Setup window, you can link one pay code per time code and vice versa using this option.

Linked pay codes and pay types must match the corresponding time codes and time types. For Canadian Payroll, the following table shows the pay types that correspond to a given time type.

The Time Code pay code relationship is 1 to 1.  Once a time code is linked to a pay code, you cannot link it to another pay code and it will not appear in the looking up to be linked.

Create Time Code that link to the Pay Code in Payroll.  Such as Sick, Vacation, and Holiday.  Select the Time Type and the Accrual Period for how often this code accrues.  If the Time Type is a Benefit, you will select a Default Accrual Schedule that you will setup after this window. Then select the Linked Pay Code.  If you mark Warn When Available Time Falls Below Zero, you will see warnings on your Payroll Batch Build report that states the Pay Code hours are below zero.  Continue to setup codes for all time that to accrue.

Anything you want visible on the employee check/earnings statement with a balance should be a time type of BENEFT which is a 4 in the table TATM1030.  If you set up a code with Absent as an example, you will not be able to accrue with this code or make it visible to the employee.  This cannot be changed once setup, unless you do this is SQL tables.

An example of an absent time type is maying you want to track how many times and employee is Tardy, but keep this as internal reporting in Dynamics GP.

select  * From tatm1030 where TIMECODE_I='XXX' 
If it is a BENEFIT type it will be a 4 in this table.
TIMETYPE_I='4' 

Time type	    Pay type
Absent	        Regular Pay
Hourly	        Regular Pay or Bonus
Salary	        Regular Pay or Bonus
Overtime	    Overtime
Benefit	        Benefit pay codes (Vacation and Sick)
Other	        Commission, Advance, or EI Rebate

6.	Mark the Warn When Available Time Falls Below Zero option if warning messages should be displayed when benefit hours are less than zero and click Save.

**Modifying or deleting a time code**

Use the Time Code Setup window to modify or delete a time code. You also can inactivate a time code if the time code is no longer being used. However, if you have Payroll transactions for employees with pay codes linked to time codes, you cannot inactivate these records. An inactive time code cannot be assigned to an employee.
To modify or delete a time code:

1.	Open the Time Code Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Attendance >> Time Code)
2.	Enter or select a time code.
3.	Make your changes in the window as needed, or to inactivate the time code, mark Inactive. Choose Save.
4.	Choose Delete to delete the time code. If the time code is attached to an employee, this option is not available.

## Benefit Setup

Before you set up the benefits that your company provides for employees, you must define benefit preferences. You will use benefit preferences to define a standard work week and work day for your organization, select a Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) year and select a method for tracking FMLA and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) payments. 

Use the following tips:  

- Human Resources includes deductions as options within the benefit setup windows. Therefore, all types of Human Resources benefits may funded by the employer, the employee, or both. Garnishments, though they are deductions, are set up in Human Resources as a type of miscellaneous benefit. U.S. Payroll, however, uses separate windows to set up benefits and deductions.  
- Benefits can be taxable, that is, the employee can be taxed on the value of the benefit received. Benefits can be calculated from net or gross pay or a deduction, as an amount per unit or as a fixed amount. Examples of benefits include insurance premiums and 401(k) matching contributions.  
- A deduction is an amount that is withheld from an employee’s net, unit or gross pay. For example, a donation to a charity, union dues and contributions to retirement plans could be set up as deductions.  
- You can set up default benefit and deduction cards and use them for setting up employee benefits and deductions. These cards also can be used to apply changes to several employees’ benefit and deduction cards.  
- If you’re using U.S. Payroll and you choose the Automatically Update Payroll Benefits and Deductions option in the Benefit Preferences window, the benefit modifications you make using Human Resources will automatically update the corresponding information in Payroll.  
- If you’ve marked the Payroll View for Human Resources option in the User Setup window, a message will appear to indicate that you must set up the corresponding codes in Payroll after you’ve defined the benefit or deduction in Human Resources to complete the integration.  
- If you didn’t mark the Payroll View for Human Resources option in the User Setup window, or you set up the benefit or deduction in Payroll, the benefit enrollment will be incomplete. Use the Reconcile Human Resources window to update the benefit setups.  

**Granting Payroll view access to a user**

Use the User Setup window to grant Payroll view access to a Human Resources user, where U.S. Payroll is, or is being, set up. You must mark the Payroll View for Human Resources option to completely set up Human Resources benefit or deduction codes and the corresponding Payroll codes.

If you don’t mark the Payroll View for Human Resources option in the User Setup window, the benefit enrollment will be incomplete. The benefit enrollment also will be incomplete if you set up the benefit or deduction in Payroll. To update benefit setups, use the Reconcile Human Resources window. 

To grant Payroll view access to a user:
1.	Open the User Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> System >> User >> enter system password)
2.	Enter or select a User ID.
3.	Mark the Payroll View for Human Resources option and choose Save.
Repeat for every user who will enter or update benefit information in Human Resources.

![the benefit setup](media/HRUSERSETUPFILL5.jpg)

**Setting up benefit preferences**

Use the Benefit Preferences window to set up benefit preferences. You can specify FMLA preferences, such as the 12-month period used by your company to calculate FMLA benefits and your company’s down days. You also can determine the prompts that will be available to users for posting specific benefits dates to the To Do list.

To set up benefit preferences: 
1.	Open the Benefit Preferences window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> Benefit Preferences)
2.	Mark Never, Always, or Ask Each Time to prompt the user for posting the FMLA return date and the payment dates to the To Do List.
3.	Choose Set FMLA 12-month Period to open the Setting FMLA 12-Month Period window. Mark the method used to calculate the FMLA 12-month period.
If you change the FMLA 12-month period, you’ll need to delete all of the employees’ previous leave instances and enter them again or the FMLA benefits won’t be calculated correctly.
4.	Choose Save. The Benefit Preferences window will be displayed.
5.	Choose FMLA Calendar to open the FMLA Calendar window. Mark None, 
Sundays Only, or Saturdays and Sundays to indicate your company-wide “down days.”
6.	Select individual calendar days to designate specific days as down days. Down days include weekends and holidays which are not counted as part of an FMLA leave. A message will appear to indicate that changing this selection will affect all employees’ FMLA leave. Choose Yes to continue.
7.	Choose OK. The Benefit Preferences window will be displayed.
8.	Accept the default number of working days in a week or the number of hours in a work day, or choose Override to make changes. The default numbers are defined in the Attendance Setup window. Refer to Setting up attendance on page 55.
9.	Mark Never, Always, or Ask Each Time to prompt the user for posting the eligibility date and the paperwork deadline dates to the To Do list.
10.	Mark the Automatically Update Payroll Benefits & Deductions option to update payroll benefit and deduction records without displaying integration messages.
11.	Choose COBRA Preferences to open the COBRA Preferences window. Mark Never, Always, or Ask Each Time to prompt the user for posting the COBRA payment dates and the coverage end date to the To Do list.
12.	Choose OK. The Benefit Preferences window will be displayed.  Choose OK to save.

Once benefit preferences are established for FMLA, they should not be changed. If they are, all entries will need to be entered again or FMLA benefits won’t be calculated correctly.

![The Benefit Preferences](media/HRBENSETUP26.jpg)


**Setting up miscellaneous benefits and garnishments**

Use the Miscellaneous Benefits Setup window to set up benefits, deductions, and combinations of both. For example, a parking allowance might be a benefit, union dues might be a deduction, and a donation to a charity with matching funds from the employer might be both a benefit and a deduction.

To set up a miscellaneous benefit:
1.	Open the Miscellaneous Benefits Setup window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> Miscellaneous Benefits)
2.	Enter an account name and description and select a frequency.
3.	Enter or select a group or agency with which the miscellaneous benefit is affiliated. If a company isn’t listed, select Affiliation and add the benefit carrier’s contact information in the Card Catalog window.
4.	Enter the beginning date and the ending date for the miscellaneous benefit. If it’s a continuous plan, leave the ending field blank.
5.	Mark Employee if the employee will contribute to the miscellaneous benefit. Select a method and mark single deduction tier or multiple tiers. If you mark a single amount or percent, enter an amount or percent. If you mark multiple tiers, choose Tiers to open the Tiered Deduction Setup window, where you can enter tiered deductions.
Enter deduction maximums. You can enter the maximum amount an employee can have deducted each pay period, each calendar year, each fiscal year, and for the entire time the employee works for your company.
6.	Mark Employer if the employer will contribute to the miscellaneous benefit. Select a method and mark a single deduction tier or multiple tiers. If you mark a single amount or percent, enter an amount or percent. If you mark multiple tiers, choose Tiers to open the Tiered Deduction Setup window, where you can enter tiered deductions.
Enter benefit maximums. You can enter the maximum amount an employer can have deducted each pay period, each calendar year, each fiscal year, and for the entire time the employee works for your company.
•	If you’ve entered contribution amounts and you’ve marked the Payroll View for Human Resources option in the User Setup window, you’ll be prompted to set up the corresponding account codes in Payroll. Choose Yes to complete the integration.
•	If you didn’t enter contribution amounts, you will not be prompted to set up the corresponding account codes in Payroll. However, you will need to set them up before you can enroll an employee in the miscellaneous benefit. To set up in Payroll, re-select the miscellaneous benefit, choose the Benefits button in the upper, right corner of the Miscellaneous Benefits Setup window, and select Payroll.

To set up a miscellaneous benefit as a garnishment:
1.	Open the Miscellaneous Benefits Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> Miscellaneous Benefits)
2.	Enter an account name and description, and select a frequency.
3.	Enter or select the garnishment recipient in the Affiliation field. If a recipient is not listed, choose the Affiliation link and add the recipient’s contact information in the Card Catalog window.
4.	Mark Garnishment.
5.	Mark Employee.
6.	Select the method of calculating the garnishment amount. The Amount Per Unit method is not permitted for garnishments.

Setting up a copayment record

Use the CoPay Setup window to define copayment codes for benefits within your company. A copayment is the amount of money that must be paid by an employee. For example, a health insurance benefit might have a $10 copayment.
To set up a copayment record:
1.	Open the CoPay Setup window.   (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> CoPay)
2.	Enter a copayment code and description. 
3.	Enter the amount of the copayment.

Setting up a health insurance coverage type

•	If you didn’t enter amounts for both the Employee and Employer fields, the corresponding codes will not have to be completed in Payroll.


**Setting up an age-based life insurance benefit**

Use the Life Insurance Setup window to set up an aged-based life insurance benefit. Premiums for an aged-based benefit change with the employee’s age. 
For example, an employee whose age is 21-34 might pay $3.00 per $1,000 of life insurance coverage and an employee whose age is 35-44 might pay $4.00 per $1,000 of life insurance coverage.

To set up an age-based life insurance benefit:
1.	Open the Life Insurance Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> Life Insurance)
2.	Enter a plan name and description of the benefit.
3.	Select the benefit frequency and enter or select the life insurance benefits carrier. 
If a company isn’t listed, choose Carrier and add the benefit carrier in the Card Catalog window.
4.	Enter the group number of the plan and the plan start date.
5.	Mark Age-Based to indicate the premium method for this benefit is based on age.

> [!TIP]
> A process runs when the first user of the day logs into a company, everyday.  It is driven from the HR Module and pertains to life insurance.  The process is called HR_Update_Age_Based_Employee.  When this process runs, it will look at all employees to see if there was a birthday and if based on your age base tables, should the employee premium get updated.  Basically the first person who logs for the day, into GP triggers a stored procedure that updates age based life insurance premiums in HR(which is linked to payroll). We do not check to see if this person has HR access or not, so you may see some random user that may have changed the age base life insurance tables as the system does this automatically for you each day at login.  [You can find more details on the Update Age Based Employee Procedure](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/f/microsoft-dynamics-gp-forum/72411/update-age-based-employee-procedure)


To set up a fixed amounts life insurance

1. Enter the increment amounts for the employee, employee’s spouse and children, if applicable. For example, if an employee can purchase insurance in $1,000 increments, enter $1,000. The Life Insurance Premiums Table window will display these amounts.
2. Choose Table to open the Life Insurance Premiums Table window. Enter the minimum age and basic premiums for the employee and the employee’s spouse, if applicable.
3. Choose the insert button to save your changes. Continue entering premium information and then close the window. The Life Insurance Setup window will be displayed. 
4. Enter the maximum amount of life insurance coverage that this plan offers.
5. Enter a multiplication factor to define the employee’s maximum amount of life insurance coverage under this plan. The factor, multiplied by the employee’s annual salary, is the employee’s maximum coverage, up to the plan’s maximum.  

  For example, assume that an employee has an annual income of $25,000. A factor of 2 would mean that the employee’s maximum life insurance coverage under this plan would be $50,000 (or the plan’s maximum coverage, whichever is smaller). Enter 0 to use the value in the Coverage Max Amt. field as the employee’s maximum coverage value.
6. If you enter a factor other than 0, select a rounding option and to indicate whether the calculated maximum coverage should be rounded up or down to match predetermined life insurance coverage increments.

  For example, assume that an employee has an annual income of $52,000, the factor is set to 2, and coverage increments are set at $10,000. The calculated maximum coverage in this case is $104,000. If you choose to round up, the employee’s maximum coverage would be set to $110,000, which is the nearest higher increment. If you choose to round down, the employee’s maximum coverage would be set to $100,000, which is the nearest lower increment.
7. Mark Portable Plan if the employee can continue the life insurance plan after leaving the company.
8. Mark how the employer pays for this benefit.

 - If you marked Increment Employee or Increment Whole Family, enter the employer Increments and Fixed Premium amounts.
 - If you marked Portion of Employee Premium, enter the employer portion of the employee premium.

    You can enter zero in the fields for employee’s and employer’s contributions. 
  - If you’ve entered contribution amounts and you’ve marked the Payroll View for Human Resources in the User Setup window, you’ll be given the option to set up the corresponding codes in Payroll. Choose Yes to complete the integration.
  - If you didn’t enter contribution amounts, the corresponding codes will not have to be completed in Payroll.
  - If you didn’t mark the Payroll View for Human Resources in the User Setup window, the benefit enrollment will be incomplete. Use the Reconcile Human Resources window to update the benefit setups. 

**Setting up a fixed-amount life insurance benefit**

Use the Life Insurance Setup window to set up a fixed amount life insurance benefit. You can define the maximum coverage amount and indicate if the plan is portable—if the employee can continue receiving this benefit after leaving the company.

To set up a fixed-amount life insurance benefit:

1. Open the Life Insurance Setup window.  (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Benefits and Deductions >> Life Insurance)
2. Enter a plan name and select the benefit frequency.
3. Enter a description of the benefit and enter or select the life insurance benefits carrier. If a company isn’t listed, choose Carrier and add the benefit carrier in the Card Catalog window.
4. Enter the group number of the plan and the plan start and end dates. If it’s a continuous plan, leave the end date blank.
5. Mark Fixed Amounts to indicate the premium method for this benefit.
6. Enter the premium increments and fixed premium amounts for the employee, employee’s spouse, and employee’s children. For example, if the premium amount is $3.00 per $1,000 of insurance, enter $1,000 in the Increments field and $3.00 in the Fixed Premium field. If the premium for smokers is different, use the Smoker field as applicable.

  Enter the full premium amounts in the Employee, Spouse, and Children fields. Any fixed premium amount contributed by the employer will be subtracted from the full premium amounts, either automatically or manually, according to the Employer Pays selection.
7. Enter the maximum amount of life insurance coverage that this plan offers.
8. Enter a multiplication factor to define the employee’s maximum amount of life insurance coverage under this plan. The factor, multiplied by the employee’s annual salary, is the employee’s maximum coverage, up to the plan’s maximum.

  For example, assume that an employee has an annual income of $25,000. A factor of 2 would mean that the employee’s maximum life insurance coverage under this plan would be $50,000 (or the plan’s maximum coverage, whichever is smaller).

  Enter 0 to use the value in the Coverage Max Amt. field as the employee’s maximum coverage value.
9. If you enter a factor other than 0, select a rounding option and to indicate whether the calculated maximum coverage should be rounded up or down to match predetermined life insurance coverage increments.  

  For example, assume that an employee has an annual income of $52,000, the factor is set to 2, and coverage increments are set at $10,000. The calculated maximum coverage in this case is $104,000. If you choose to round up, the employee’s maximum coverage would be set to $110,000, which is the nearest higher increment. If you choose to round down, the employee’s maximum coverage would be set to $100,000, which is the nearest lower increment.
10. Mark Portable Plan if the employee can continue the life insurance plan after leaving the company.
11. Mark how the employer pays for this benefit.  

  - If you marked Increment Employee or Increment Whole Family, specify the portion of the insurance premium that the employer pays for each increment. The employer’s portion of the premium is automatically subtracted from the employee’s total premium (including, if applicable, Spouse, and Children, but not including Smoker) and must be less than or equal to the employee’s total premium.
  - If you marked Portion of Employee Premium, enter the employer fixed premium, and change the employee total fixed premium entries (including, if applicable, Spouse, and Children, but not including Smoker) so their total is reduced by the amount of the employer fixed premium.
