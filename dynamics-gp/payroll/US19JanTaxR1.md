### Withholding changes for Colorado

All filing status have the same fixed flat tax of 4.40% was 4.55% (2022).

- The Personal Exemption amount is $10,000 for MAR
- The Personal Exemption amount is $5,000 For SINGLE

**The following new filing status were added January 2022:**

- HOH1J - Head of Household 1 Job - Exemption amount  $20,000  
- MAR1J - Married Filing Jointly 1 Job - Exemption amount  $27,500  
- SIN1J - Single/Mar filing Single 1 Job - Exemption amount  $12,500  

In January 2022 the state of Colorado released a new form called [DR-0004](https://tax.colorado.gov/withholding-forms) this is optional for an employee to complete.  

There are 2 other parts to this form that have many different exemption amounts, we cannot accommodate all of them in the tax tables.

A new “OTHER” filing status was added (OTH1J) with Exemption increments of $500 that will accommodate all the "other" amounts on the form if an employee enters. 

OTH1J - OTH, +1 Jobs or Child Cr Allow - Exemption amount of $500

As an example, lets say I fill out the form and choose an amount of 2500. It does not match any of the above filing status so I would pick the OTHER status and put a 5 under Cards | Payroll | State Tax in the Number of Dependents field OR Additional Allowances. Which is 2500/500 = 5.

Another example, I put 5500 on the form. Again, it does not match the other filing status, so I choose *Other* and put *11*.

### Withholding changes for Hawaii

- The Standard Deduction Amount is $1,650 (New 2025)

If your computer isn't connected to the Internet, you can obtain the file from [Dynamics GP Downloads](/dynamics/s-e/gp/tugp2018_391) or your Microsoft Partner and copy it to your computer before running what's known as a "manual" installation.

Tax updates are distributed in the form of .CAB files. Copy the .CAB file to a folder that you can readily access, such as the folder that contains Dynamics.exe. Copying the .CAB file to your computer does not complete the installation. Refer to the following section for instructions on how to install the tax update.

## Installing the tax update

The tax update installation can be run from any workstation. The update installs payroll tax table data on the server computer where your existing Microsoft Dynamics GP application data is located. You need to install the tax table update only once.

If you have issues installing the update, review the article on [Tips to install the U.S. Payroll Tax
Update.](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp/archive/2017/05/09/tips-to-install-the-u-s-payroll-tax-update)

Before you begin, ask all Microsoft Dynamics GP users to exit the application until the update is complete. Exit all other applications, turn off the screen saver, and back up important data (including Forms.dic, Reports.dic, and Dynamics.vba if they exist) before you proceed with the installation.

1. Log onto Microsoft Dynamics GP with the system administrator rights, (user SA) and open the Payroll Tax Update window.
    (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Maintenance \>\> U.S. Payroll Updates \>\> Check for Tax Updates)

2. Select an update method, and then choose Next.

    - The Automatic option downloads the current tax table update from the Internet to the default location. An Internet connection is required.
    - The Manual option processes the tax table update from a location you choose. You might choose Manual if you need to update a computer that isn't connected to the Internet. To use this method, you should already have obtained the tax table update file, [TX.cab](/dynamics/s-e/gp/tugp2018_391), and copied it to a location your computer can readily access.

3. If you selected Automatic, enter your 10-digit authorized telephone number. Choose Log in to start the download.

    If you selected Manual, specify the location where the tax table update file is located.

4. Choose Process to start the update.

5. Verify that the latest Payroll tax table update has been installed. Choose Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \>\> Tools \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Payroll Tax. The Last Tax Update value should be *1/22/2025*.

## What's next

If you upgrade to another version of Microsoft Dynamics GP, you must install the most recent service pack (if any), as well as the most recent tax table updates for that release, to ensure you have the latest tax information. Newer releases of Microsoft Dynamics GP do not include current payroll tax information.
