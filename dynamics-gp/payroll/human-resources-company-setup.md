# Human Resources - Company Setup and Organizational Structure

Your company's organizational structure might include multiple levels, such as divisions, departments, positions, supervisors, and locations. You can create these levels and store additional information for each level in the Human REsources functionality of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)].

A division is a branch of a company, usually including several departments. A department is a specialized portion of a division or company, which usually concentrates on one type of task. You'll use several windows to enter the various types of organizational information for your business. Some companies conduct business from more than one site or location and each site has a different address.

Each position has certain physical requirements. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities. Use the Position Setup window to enter employee positions, and use the ADA Physical Requirements window to define the physical requirements for each position.

Many positions require special skills and training and you can link training courses and classes to position codes. You can use the Position Course Link window and the Courses Available to Link window to link skill and training requirements to position codes.

You can use position control to plan future positions and roll down information from the planned positions and position seats to employees. Position control is optional.  

Use the Company Human Resources Setup window to set up company human resources information, such as the type of business and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), Dun & Bradstreet (DUNS), North America Industry Classification System (NAICS), and Vets-100 numbers. You can set up human resources information for each company.

To set up company human resources information:

1. Open the Company Human Resources Setup window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Company >> Company >> Human Resources button)

## Understanding pay steps

Before you can begin using the pay steps feature, you need to activate it in the Human Resources Preferences window. The pay steps feature integrates with U.S. Payroll, but is not available with Canadian Payroll.

You can use pay steps to associate an employee's amount of time in a position with a rate of pay. A pay step table lists pay steps (or grades) by number, the assigned duration of each step, and the dollar amounts for each step under successive effective dates.

For example, after an employee has served in a position for the full duration of a pay step, the employee advances to the next pay step and its corresponding pay rate under the current effective date. When the next effective date arrives, the employee advances to the new pay rate for the current pay step.
The following illustration is an example of a pay step table.

When you assign an employee and an associated pay code to a pay step table (in the Employee/Pay Step Table Entry window or the Employee Pay Code Maintenance window), you can base the step increases on the employee's hire date, adjusted hire date, seniority date, or a manually entered date.

The Payroll system creates post-dated pay rates for the future increases indicated in the pay steps table. A reminder on your Microsoft Dynamics GP home page lists employee post-dated pay rates eligible for activation. After you activate an employee's post-dated pay rate, it becomes effective, on the designated date, for all future pay periods.
To use the example illustration: assume that the step increases are based on the hire date, and that the pay rates are activated. If the employee was hired on July 25, 2006, and the current date is May 25, 2007, the employee would be in pay step 1, with a pay rate of $20.00. On July 25, 2007, the employee would advance to pay step 2, with a pay rate of $25.00. On January 01, 2008, the next column of pay rates would become effective, and the employee's pay rate would advance to $26.00.

You can use multiple pay step tables to associate pay rates with other employee qualifications, such as education, in addition to time in a position. For example, if you base employee pay rates, in part, on education level, you can create a pay step table for "Bachelor's Degree" and another for "Master's Degree."

You can use the Microsoft Dynamics GP system's Activity Tracking feature to monitor pay step table additions, changes, and deletions. Select either the activity type Access Tracking, or Field Tracking. For more information about Activity Tracking, refer to the System Setup documentation.

## Setting up pay step tables

You can create, save, modify, and delete pay step tables. In the Pay Step Table Entry window, you can create pay step tables having as many steps, number of months in each step, and effective dates, as you want. You can also enter past effective dates to record historical pay rate information.

You can export pay step table information to a Microsoft Excel&reg; file, for further analysis and review.

Within a pay step table, you can add, copy, and delete columns, and delete rows.
For more information about changing and using a pay step table after you set it up, see Modifying or deleting pay step table data on page 28 and Assigning a pay step table to employees on page 185.

### To set up a pay step table

1. Open the Pay Step Table Entry window.   (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Pay Step Table)
2. Enter a pay step table ID and a short description.
3. Select a unit of pay, either Hourly Rate or Salary.
4. Enter the effective date. This date indicates when a new column of pay rates becomes effective, typically 01 January of successive years. You can enter any past, present, or future date.
5. Enter the step (or grade) number into the pay step table.
6. Enter the duration of this pay step as a range of months. For example, a range of 0 to 11 indicates that a new employee remains at this pay step for the first 12 months of employment.
7. Enter a dollar amount in the cell across from the step number and below the effective date.
8. Press the TAB key to begin a new row.
