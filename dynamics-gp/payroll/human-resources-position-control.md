# Human Resources - Position Control Setup

You can use position control to plan the positions that you will have in your organization and to track the funding sources for those positions.

Position control is optional. For companies other than the sample company, you use registration to activate it. Position control is especially useful for state and local governments, schools, and other organizations that depend on public funding.

You can create one current position plan and an unlimited number of other position plans. The other position plans are used for future planning and what-if scenarios.
You also can import position plans from Microsoft Excel. You can set up fund account information to specify the general ledger accounts that are affected during payroll processing for employees who hold a seat for a position.

[Human Resources Position Control, what is it and should I be using it?](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp/posts/human-resources-position-control-what-is-it-and-should-i-be-using-it)

## Positions, position seats, and position plans

A position is a role in an organization, such as a teacher. Each position can have attributes such as a location, division, vacation and sick time, benefits, and pay codes. These attributes are rolled down to employee records through a process called inheritance. You can make changes to the position and automatically apply those changes to multiple employees. 

Each position can have multiple instances, called position seats. A school district might plan to hire five teachers, so there would be five seats. A seat can be filled by one employee at a time.

With position control, you can create one current position plan that represents the positions that your organization has at the present time. You can also create an unlimited number of other position plans. The other position plans are used for future planning and what-if scenarios. A position plan is identified by a position plan code. 
Position budgets, seat budgets, and fund sources

A position budget represents the budgeted amount of an employer's expense for a position, for a period of time. You can budget a certain amount of money for expenses related to a position for a period of time. You can also assign funding sources to the budget, with each source representing a percentage of the total. A funding source might be a grant or other allocation of funds from another organization. For example, a school might receive a grant to fund a teacher's aide position that did not previously exist in your organization. 

A seat budget represents the budgeted amount of an employer's expense for a seat, for a period of time. You can also assign funding sources to the budget, with each source representing a percentage of the total. For example, a school might receive a grant to fund an additional three seats of the teacher's aide position. 

## Position control effects on payroll processing

Position control affects the way that payroll transactions are processed in the following ways:

- By removing transactions that do not fit the criteria for the *CURRENT position plan. This helps to ensure that you do not pay employees for positions that are not part of the position plan.
- By updating pay rates based on seat detail records. This helps to ensure that employees are paid the correct amount based on the position seat that they are assigned to. For example, if an employee is temporarily assigned to a seat that pays more than their regular pay rate, the employee can be paid at the higher rate.

## Removing transactions

Payroll transactions for employees are removed from pay runs in the following situations:

- There was a problem with the inheritance process and information was not completely copied from the position and seat to the employee record.
- The employee is not assigned to a seat detail record for the position that is assigned to the payroll transaction.
- The assignment status is On Hold without Pay and Benefits for the seat detail record for the employee.
- The assignment status is Expired for the seat detail record for the employee.
- The payroll transaction date is outside the start date and end date range for the seat detail record.
- The seat is inactive.

## Updating pay rates based on seat detail records

Pay rates can be based on the seat detail records regardless of whether you enter the transactions in the Payroll Transaction Entry window or the Mass Payroll Transaction Entry window.
The pay rates from the seat detail records override the pay rate from the Employee Pay Code Maintenance window when a payroll build is processed, if the following conditions are met:

- The Seat option is selected in the Pay Rate Based On field in the Position Seat Detail window.
- The employee is assigned to the seat.
- The payroll transaction date is between the start date and end date for the seat assignment.
- The pay code is the primary pay code for the position, or a pay code that is based on a primary pay code. For example, if the primary pay code is Hourly, the related Overtime pay code is also overridden.
- The frequency of the pay code in the Position Seat Detail window matches the frequency of the pay code in the Employee Pay Code Maintenance window. For example, if the pay code is a weekly amount in one window, it must be weekly in the other window.

## Fund account effects on payroll processing

Typically, when payroll checks are calculated, the payroll posting accounts that are specified in the Posting Account Setup window are used. If you are using position control, the payroll check calculation process also uses the fund accounts that are specified in the Position Budget Fund Sources window. The segments from these accounts can be combined dynamically to determine the posting accounts that are actually used. This enables you to override the payroll posting accounts for a period of time, and then easily revert to the original posting accounts. 

For example, you receive a grant to build a park, and the project is expected to last for four months. You can set up a fund source and fund account for the positions that are included in the grant, and then use the Fund Account Options to specify the source of the account segments that are used to generate the posting accounts that are used for payroll processing. In this example, you would create a budget schedule and corresponding fund source for the four-month period of the park project. When the four-month time frame has elapsed, the system will automatically stop allocating funds to the grant associated with the park project.

You can specify the source of account segments for the following expense pay types:

- Gross Pay
- Benefits Expense
- Taxable Benefits Expense
- Employers Tax Expense - FICA/Medicare
- Employers Tax Expense - FICA/Social Security

## Setting up position control

If you are using position control, use the Position Control Setup window to select budget override options for permanent seats, temporary seats, full-time equivalents (FTEs), and employer expenses, and whether to save override information to history. Your selections in this window apply when a change is made that would cause the actual employer expense for a position to exceed the budgeted employer expense for the position. You can also specify whether unassigned positions are included when making payroll builds.

### To set up position control

1. Open the Position Control Setup window. (Microsoft Dynamics GP menu >> Tools >> Setup >> Human Resources >> Position Control >> Position Control)
2. Choose budget override options for permanent seats, temporary seats, FTEs, and employer expenses.

    The following options are available.

    |Override option |Column2  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Allowed |Allows you to exceed budget amounts without any warning.   |
    |Warning    |  Allows you to exceed budget amounts, but provides a warning. |
    |Password Required   | Requires you to enter a password to exceed budget amounts.|
    |Not Allowed   | Does not allow you to exceed budget amounts.|

3. Choose whether to allow, disallow, or issue a warning before including employees with no seat assignments in payroll builds.
4. Mark the Save Changes to History option to save the budget override changes to history.
5. Mark the Enable Position Control in Sample Company option if you want to use position control in the sample company, Fabrikam, Inc. 
You must restart Microsoft Dynamics GP for the change to take effect.
6. Choose OK to save changes.

## Setting up position plan codes
