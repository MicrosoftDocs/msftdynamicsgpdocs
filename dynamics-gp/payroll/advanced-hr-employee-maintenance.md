# Advanced Human Resources in Microsoft Dynamics GP - Employee Maintenance

After completing the [required setup](advanced-hr-setup.md) for advanced HR in Dynamics GP, the next step is to assign
data to employee records. Advanced Human Resources allows the organization
to input data for benefit plan changes in advance of the effective date by
using future effective records, allows certifications, licenses and training
courses and classes to be assigned to individual employees once attained or
completed, and finally allows for the collection of additional data for a
work-related injury or illness.

## Benefit Lifecycle Manager

The first component of Advanced Human Resources is the Benefit Lifecycle
Manager. This component has added additional fields to the employee
dependent and beneficiary windows. In addition, benefits can now be assigned
to dependents for better tracking of insurance coverages and costs.

### Employee Dependents Window

Within the Employee Dependents window, data fields have been added to set up
dependents associated with the employee. To open this window, click the **HR
and Payroll** series button, click **Human Resources o**n the Cards content
pane, click **Employee** and then click **Dependents**.

The data fields are listed below:

- **Status** – Active or Inactive

- **Status Comment** – These options are defined in the Plan Status Reason
    window

- **Change Date**

- **Marital Status** – Married, Single or N/A

- **Change Date**

- **Disabled** checkbox

- **Disabled Date**

### Employee Beneficiaries Window

Within the Employee Beneficiaries window, additional data fields are
available to define beneficiaries associated with the employee and specific
benefit plan. To open this window, click the **HR and Payroll** series
button, click the **Human Resources** on the Cards content pane, click
**Employee - Benefits**, select a **Benefit Enrollment** option, select an
**Employee ID**, select a **Benefit code**, click the **Benefit** icon and
then click **Beneficiary Definition**.

The data fields are listed below:

- **Plan Status** – Active or Inactive

- **Status Change Reason** – lookup button now allows information to be
    defaulted from existing Dependents.

- **Status Comment** – These options are defined in the Plan Status Reason
    window

- **Change Date**

- **Marital Status** – Married, Single or N/A

- **Change Date**

- **Disabled** checkbox

- **Disabled Date**

### Assign Template Window

Selecting a Template will create employee and code records for all codes
associated with that Template. You can then assign any Dates and Results to
those codes in this window.

Example: There may be a template for New Employees that would have listed 5
Immunizations, Vaccinations and Tests that a new employee would need. You
could assign that template and the system would create the 5 records. If
only 3 were needed, then you would uncheck the 2 that do not apply.

To open the Assign Template window, click the **HR and Payroll** series
button, click **Human Resources** on the Cards content pane, click
**Employee**, click **Health and Wellness**, enter an **Employee ID** and
then click the **Assign Template** button.

1. Enter or select a **Template Code**.

2. The **Description** displays from the Health and Wellness Template Setup
    window.

3. The Scrolling window allows you to associate Health and Wellness codes with
    a Template Code.

### Employee Benefit Dependents Window

The Employee Benefit Dependents window allows Human Resources to define the
employee dependents associated with a specific employee benefit plan. To
open this window, click the **HR and Payroll** series button, click **Human
Resources** on the Cards content pane, click **Employee - Benefits** and
select a **Benefit Enrollment** option, enter an **Employee ID**, select a
**Benefit code**, click the **Benefits icon** and then click **Dependents**.

### Future Effective Activation Window

The Future Effective Activation window is used to activate the future effective date records. The following steps should be followed. To open this window, click the **HR and Payroll** series button, click **Human Resources** on the Utilities content pane and then click **Activate Future Effective Benefits**.

![Screenshot of the Future Effective Activation window.](media/ADVHRFES.jpg)

Within the Future Effective Activation scrolling window, the records can be
sorted ascending or descending by columns. This window will display all
Future Effective records that currently exist and will default sorted by
Effective Date in ascending order.

- Select the **Activate** checkbox to process the Future Effective Activation for this benefit code. When selected, if corresponding HR or Payroll Future
    Effective records exist the system prompts: "Do you want to select corresponding HR/Payroll records?

  - **Yes** prompts the user to select the Activate checkbox for all records that exist equal to the Benefit Code.

  - **No** prompts the user to select the Activate checkbox for the one record.

    Select **Mark All** or **Unmark All** to select or unselect all Future Effective records displayed in the scrolling window.

- **Process** validates that there are current records marked as ACTIVATE.

  - If there are no current records marked as ACTIVATE or any records available to process, the system prompts: "You have not marked any
        records for processing."

  - If there are current records marked as ACTIVATE the process moves the current Microsoft Dynamics GP records to the Benefit Lifecycle Manager history tables, then moves the Benefit Lifecycle Manager FutureEffective records into the core Microsoft Dynamics GP tables and remove them from the Benefit Lifecycle Manager pending tables. Remember to  ACTIVATE the codes on or past the Effective Date. By ACTIVATING before the Effective Date will make the changes current, regardless of the Effective Date.

Once the process is complete, the window will close.

The records in the window can be printed by selecting the **Print** icon on
the window. The print will display the records in the order that they appear
on the window.

## Certification, License and Training Manager

The next component of Advanced Human Resources is Certification, License and
Training Manager. Using this component, the user can assign certifications
such as a Human Resources certification to a particular employee. In
addition, licenses with unique identifying numbers can be assigned. This
could be as simple as a driver's license or as complex as the DEA and other
Medical Licenses required by a doctor. Another part of Advanced Human
Resources enhances the Employee

Training window allowing more information to be tracked. Finally, Advanced
Human Resources allows the user to update multiple employee training records
with completion and expiration dates by using a course/class combination.
