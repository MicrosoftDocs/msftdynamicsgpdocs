# Purchase Order Processing Part 4: Purchase order returns

This part of the documentation includes information about using purchase order returns. The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 23, "Returns transactions,"* describes how to process returns from Purchase Order Processing.

- *Chapter 24, "Taxes for returns,"* contains information about tax calculation in purchase order returns.

## Chapter 23: Returns transactions

Returning goods to vendors is a common event during the purchase order life cycle. Returns can occur anytime—before or after receipt of the vendor's invoice—and returns may or may not involve credit. purchase order returns makes it possible for you to process purchase order returns quickly and easily, with or without credit to the vendor, based on the specific circumstances of that return.

*You will have to make a manual adjustment within Payables Management for restocking fees charged by the vendor. This release of purchase order returns does not include a field for these fees.*

You can start to use purchase order returns immediately. No special setup is necessary.

Purchase order returns transaction information is divided into the following sections:

- *About purchase order returns*

- *Purchase order returns and Project Accounting*

- *Return transaction document types*

- *Quantity Tolerances for purchase order returns*

- *Creating a purchasing returns batch*

### About purchase order returns

You can process returns against both Purchase Order Processing receipts and Inventory receipts. Items that have been received on a shipment or shipment/invoice receipt are available to be returned as a Return or a Return w/Credit document type. Items that have been transferred to another site, added to inventory through an inventory adjustment or variance, or returned by a customer are available to be returned in Purchase Order Processing as an Inventory or Inventory w/Credit document type.

Using purchase order approvals, you can process returns against the following receipt types:

| **Module**        | **Receipt types** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Inventory Control | Adjustment        |
|                   | Variance          |
|                   | Transfer          |
|                   | Sales return      |

When you post a return, the original transaction amount is offset against quantities in inventory and the applicable General Ledger accounts. If the unit cost of the item has changed, you can return at the new unit cost (applicable to returns with credit only). If you are using Multicurrency Management, you can return items involving alternative currencies.

When you process a Return w/Credit return document, a return transaction is created in Payables Management. The return transaction must be manually applied to the invoice from the vendor. See the Payables Management documentation (Help \>\> Printable Manuals) for more information.

### Purchase order returns and Project Accounting

If you are using Project Accounting, you can enter project information on standard purchase orders and drop-ship purchase orders in Purchase Order Processing. Items received from a standard purchase order are stored in inventory. To transfer items to a project, you'll use the Inventory Transfer Entry window in Projecting Accounting. Items from a drop-ship purchase order are invoiced and transferred to a project automatically.

You can use purchase order returns to return an item that is in inventory. This is called a project return-from inventory transaction. If the item has been transferred to a project, you can use Project Accounting to return the item. See the Project Accounting documentation for more information.

### Return transaction document types

You can process purchasing returns using the following return transaction document types:

- Return

- Return w/Credit

- Inventory

- Inventory w/Credit

*You must use the document types Return or Return w/Credit to return non-inventoried items or any items with the item types of Misc Charges, Flat Fee, or Services. Returns against kit items are not allowed.*

Each of the return document types is described in detail as follows.

**Return**

Select Return for shipment receipts or shipment/invoice receipts when the item is not matched to an invoice and vendor credit is not applicable. An example would be when the item is being replaced.

Manual adjustments may be necessary for return documents using the Return document type, refer to *Processing manual adjustments for returns when closing purchase order lines* for more information.

**Return w/Credit**

Select Return w/Credit for shipment receipts that are matched with an invoice, or shipment/invoice receipts when vendor credit is applicable.

*To return all of the items on a partially invoiced receipt, you must complete two return transactions: one for the invoiced items using document type Return w/Credit and another for the uninvoiced items using document type Return.*

**Inventory**

Select Inventory for inventory adjustment receipts, variance receipts, transfer receipts and sales return receipts when the item is not matched to an invoice and vendor credit is not applicable. An example would be when the item is being replaced. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't enter this return document type for project return-from-inventory transactions.

When you process an Inventory return, if the items being returned will be replaced by the vendor, you must make adjusting journal entries to remove the accrual created by the new shipment receipt.

**Inventory w/Credit**

Select Inventory w/Credit for inventory adjustment receipts, variance receipts, transfer receipts and sales return receipts when vendor credit is applicable. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't enter this return document type for project return-from-inventory transactions.

When you process a Return w/Credit return document or Inventory w/Credit return document type, a return transaction is created in Payables Management. The return transaction must be manually applied to the invoice from the vendor. See the Payables Management documentation (Help \>\> Printable Manuals) for more information.

### Quantity Tolerances for purchase order returns

You set up quantity tolerances for shortages and overages for the quantity ordered on a standard purchase order or a blanket purchase order. Review the following information on how returning and replacing quantities affect the calculation when determining if a quantity is within the tolerance set up for an item.

**Shortage**

If an item's quantity is returned or partially returned, the option to replace quantities on the transaction is taken into account when determining if the quantity is within the tolerance amount and whether the line item status is Received or Closed. The return quantity is not taken into account when calculating the shortage tolerance.

**Example 1**

In the following example, the quantity returned is not replaced.

| Quantity ordered for a purchase order is 100.                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quantity overage tolerance percentage is 10%.                                                                                                                                        |
| You enter a receivings transaction for a quantity of 80.                                                                                                                             |
| The purchase order has a Released status.                                                                                                                                            |

| The purchase order and the line item has a Released status.                                                                                                                          |
| You enter another receivings transaction.                                                                                                                                            |
| If the quantity for the item has a quantity of 9 or less, the line item status is Released.                                                                                          |
| If the quantity for the item has a quantity of 10 or more, the remaining quantity is canceled and the status for the item is Received or Closed if the item has been fully invoiced. |

**Overage**

If an item's quantity is returned or partially returned and the return has been marked to replace returned items, the return quantity is taken into account when calculating the overage tolerance. If the quantity received is over the overage tolerance, the following message displays.

You can't enter a quantity greater than the combined total of the Remaining to Receive quantity and the overage tolerance set up for the item.

**Example 1**

In the following example, the quantity returned is not replaced

| The net quantity order is the quantity order minus the quantity canceled.            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purchase order net quantity is 100.                                                  |

### Creating a purchasing returns batch

Use the Returns Batch Entry window to create a return batch. All transactions in the batch must originate with Returns Transaction Entry window.

**To create a purchasing returns batch:**

1. Open the Returns Batch Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Batches)

    ![screenshot Returns Batch Entry](media/POage201.jpg)

2. Enter a batch ID to identify the batch.

3. Enter a batch comment (optional).

4. Enter a posting date.

    This field is available only if Batch is selected in the Posting Date From field in the Posting Setup window.

    The posting date you enter here is the date that General Ledger files are updated. Your records in Purchase Order Processing are updated based on the date of the return.

5. Choose Save to save the batch.

To verify the transactions you entered, print a returns Edit List. For more information, see *Printing purchasing returns transactions*.

### Processing purchasing return transactions

Use the Returns Transaction Entry window to process purchasing return transactions.

If you're using multiple bins and a default purchase returns bin exists at either the item-site or the site, the quantity at the default bin will decrease by the extended quantity for an item that is not tracked by serial or lot numbers. You can modify the default bin selections. If a default purchase returns bin doesn't exist, you will be required to enter one. For serial- and lot-numbered items, the purchase returns bin is the bin associated with the serial or lot number, and you can't to change the bin.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Returns Transaction Entry window. To enter a return for a project return-from-inventory transaction, see *Processing project return from-inventory transactions*.

**To process purchasing return transactions:**

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Purchasing button, and then choose the All Purchasing Transactions list.

2. Select a shipment receipt or a shipment/invoice receipt.

3. Choose Purchase Returns Transactions and then select a document type to open the Returns Transaction Entry window.

    ![screenshot Returns Transaction Entry window](media/POage203.jpg)

4. Select a document type for the return transaction. For more information about return document types, see *Return transaction document types*

5. Enter a return number or accept the default entry. The default entry will be the next available receipt number in the Purchase Order Processing Setup window.

6. Enter a vendor document number. A vendor document number is required for returns with credit.

7. Enter the return date. The user date is the default entry.

    To enter a General Ledger posting date or a tax date that is different from the return date, choose the Date expansion button; the Returns Date Entry window will open.

    For multicurrency transactions and for document types Return w/Credit, Inventory, and Inventory w/Credit, the return document date determines the exchange rate that will be used, based on the currency ID that's entered for the transaction and the associated rate type. For a Return document type, the exchange rate of the original receipt will be assigned to each return line. There is no overall exchange rate for the transaction.

8. Enter or select a batch ID (optional). See *Creating a purchasing returns batch* for more information.

9. Enter or select a vendor ID.

10. Enter or accept the currency ID. The default currency ID will be the currency ID assigned to the vendor you selected. If no currency ID has been assigned for this vendor, the company's functional currency will be used.

    The currency ID assigned to the return must match the currency ID of the receipts in the scrolling window.

    If the selected currency ID is not the company's functional currency, a rate type and associated exchange rate table will be assigned to the transaction. The rate type is based on the rate type assigned to the selected vendor. If the vendor does not have a rate type assigned, the default rate type for the Purchasing series specified in the Multicurrency Setup window is used.

    For Return w/Credit, Inventory, and Inventory w/Credit returns, you can view or modify the default exchange rate by choosing the currency ID expansion button to open the Exchange Rate Entry window. For more information about exchange rates, refer to the Multicurrency Management documentation.

11. To select an option for how returned goods are invoiced, mark a combination of the Replace Returned Goods and Invoice Expected for Returned Goods fields.

    The following table shows which options to choose.

    | **Options marked** | **When to use** | **Results** | **Notes** |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | Replace Returned Goods and Invoice Expected for Returned Goods | When you want to replace the returned goods, using the original purchase order. When you have yet to process the invoice for the original goods. When you want to process an invoice for all of the original quantity of goods received (even though you have returned some of them). | Returned goods are replaced. The same purchase order is used for the replaced goods. You can process the invoice for all of the original goods, including the goods that will be replaced. | If the original purchase order is no longer available (for example, moved to history), a new one is created automatically. The new purchase order includes only the returned goods and quantity that you want to replace. The Invoice Expected from Vendor option is available only for return types Return or Inventory. |
    | Replace Returned Goods | When you want to replace the returned goods, using the original purchase order. When you do not expect to receive an invoice for the goods you're returning, or when you do not expect the invoice to match the original quantity of goods. | Returned items are replaced. The same purchase order is used for the replaced items. | You can process an invoice for only the goods you kept, not the returned goods. If the original purchase order is no longer available (for example, moved to history), a new one is created automatically. The new purchase order includes only the returned goods and quantity that you want to replace. Invoices that you already have processed are not affected by choosing this option. |
    | Invoice Expected for Returned Goods | When you do not want to replace the returned goods. For example, when you expect a refund or a credit. When you want to close the purchase order when the invoice is processed. | The credit or refund occurs separately from the original invoice. When you process the invoice, the purchase order is automatically closed. | You returned some goods, but did not ask to replace them. Thus, the transaction is complete and the purchase order is closed. |
    | Neither option is marked | When you do not want to replace the returned goods. For example, when you expect a refund or a credit. When you have already processed the invoice, or when you do not expect to receive an invoice from the vendor. | The credit or refund occurs separately from the original invoice. | You can process an invoice for only the goods that you kept, not the returned goods. Invoices that you already have processed are not affected by choosing this option. |

12. If the item being returned was purchased from an EU vendor, mark EU Transaction. See *Entering Intrastat trade statistics for returns* for more information.

13. If the item being returned is subject to withholding tax, mark the Subject to Withholding option and enter or accept the tax rate. If a withholding vendor hasn't been specified in the Company Setup Options window, these fields will not be available.

14. Use the scrolling window to select the items to be returned and to match the items to receipts.

    For document types Return or Return w/Credit, enter or select the purchase order number applicable to this return. You can leave this field blank if you prefer. All purchase orders that have been received for this vendor will be available in the Purchase Orders lookup window.

    The PO Number field is not available for document types Inventory and Inventory w/Credit.

    Only standard purchase orders that have been received can be returned. You cannot process returns for drop-ship, canceled, or on-hold purchase orders.

15. Enter or select the items you want to return using either the vendor's item number or your company's item number.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can display the vendor's item number by marking Display Vendor Items (Options \>\> Display Vendor Item). If the option is not marked, your company's item number will be displayed. You can change this selection at any time.

    Non-inventoried items cannot be selected from the lookup window, however, you can return these by entering the item number.

    To add an attachment to the item, select the item and choose the Attachment Management icon to open the Document Attachment Management window.

16. Enter or select the receipt number for this return.

    You must select an item, or a vendor item, before you can select the receipt number.

    The currency ID of the receipt you select must match the currency ID of the return document.

    If the receipt number that you enter is matched to more than one receipt line or inventory receipt line, a lookup window (Purchasing Returns PO Receipt Numbers window or Purchasing Returns Inventory Receipt Numbers window) will open allowing you to select the applicable receipt line. The Purchasing Returns PO Receipt Numbers lookup window displays the unit of measure from the original receipt which may be different from the unit of measure in the Returns Transaction Entry window.

    If there's more than one invoice receipt attached to the receipt number you select, the Purchasing Returns PO Invoice Receipt Numbers lookup window will open automatically allowing you to select the applicable invoice receipt.

    If there are no quantities available for the receipt number that you entered, you will have the option to search for another receipt. If you choose yes, a lookup window will open where you can select another receipt with the same item.

    The only way to change a receipt number after it has been entered is to delete the return line and reenter the information.

17. Enter or accept the unit of measure.

18. Enter the quantity to be returned or accept the default entry, that is, the total quantity available on the selected receipt.

    If you're using multiple bins, the total quantity selected for bins must equal the extended quantity of the line item.

19. The default entry for unit cost of the item or vendor item is based on the document type.

    The following table lists the default unit cost for each document type.

    | **Document type**       | **Default unit cost**                 |
    |-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | Return with/Credit      | The original invoice receipt          |
    | Inventory w/Credit      | The posted inventory purchase receipt |
    | Return or Inventory AND | The average cost of the item          |

    — If Item type is Average Perpetual

    — If Item type is Periodic

    — If any other item type

    The standard cost of the item

    The original shipment receipt

    If necessary, you can change the unit cost for returns with credit.

    If you change the default unit cost, a purchase price variance will occur. Also, if landed costs are included in the original shipment receipt, a purchase price variance will occur.

    If the returned item is tracked by lot or serial number, the Returns Lot or Returns Serial Number Entry window will open when you leave the line. Select the lot or serial numbers to be returned. See *Assigning lot numbers to a return* or *Assigning serial numbers to a return* for more information.

    If you are using multiple bins, the Bin Quantity Entry window will open if a returned item that isn't tracked by lot or serial numbers requires you to enter bin information. The total quantity selected for bins must equal the line's extended quantity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You also can open the Purchasing Returns Lot Number Entry window or the **Purchasing Returns Serial Entry** window by choosing **Show Details** on the **Returns Transaction Entry** window, and then choosing **Serial/Lot**. To open the **Bin Quantity Entry** window, choose Show Details \>\> Bins.

20. Enter or accept the 1099 amount if applicable for a 1099 vendor and returns with credit.

21. If your system is set up to calculate taxes using the Advanced tax calculation method and you're entering a return with credit, enter or accept the Tax Schedule ID.

22. Enter or accept trade discount, freight and miscellaneous amounts for returns with credit.

    If your system is using the Advanced tax calculation method, taxes on freight and miscellaneous will be calculated automatically.

23. Taxes will be calculated automatically as you enter items.

    - To change the tax amounts for the document, see *Calculating and distributing summary taxes for returns* for more information. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't change the tax amount in the Returns Transaction Entry window for return and return with credit transactions even if your system is set up to allow editing summary-level taxes.

    - To change the tax amounts for a line item, use the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window. See *Calculating and distributing detail taxes for return line items* for more information.

    - If your system is set up to enable GST for Australia/New Zealand and you want to indicate that a tax invoice has been received, see *Returns for Australia/New Zealand*.

If you're using multiple bins and posting fails, bin quantities will revert to their previous values.

### Processing project return-from-inventory transactions

If you are using Project Accounting, you can use the Returns Transaction Entry window to process project return-from-inventory transactions.

If you're using multiple bins and a default purchase returns bin exists at either the item-site or the site, the quantity at the default bin will decrease by the extended quantity for an item that is not tracked by serial or lot numbers. You can modify the default bin selections. If a default purchase returns bin doesn't exist, you will be required to enter one. For serial- and lot-numbered items, the purchase returns bin is the bin associated with the serial or lot number and you won't be able to change the bin.

**To process project return-from-inventory transactions:**

1. Open the Returns Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry)

    ![screenshot Returns Transaction Entry](media/POage205.jpg)

2. Select a return type for the return transaction. See *Return transaction document types* for more information about return document types.

3. Enter a return number or accept the default entry. The default entry will be the next available receipt number in the Purchasing Invoice Setup window.

4. You can enter a vendor document number.

5. Enter the return date. The user date is the default date.

    To enter a General Ledger posting date or a tax date that is different than the return date, choose the Date expansion button; the Returns Date Entry window will open.

    For multicurrency transactions and for the document type Return w/Credit, the return document date determines the exchange rate that will be used, based on the currency ID entered for the transaction and the associated rate type. For a Return document type, the exchange rate of the original receipt is assigned to the transaction. See the Multicurrency Management documentation (Help \>\> Printable Manuals) for more information.

6. Enter or select a batch ID (optional). See *Creating a purchasing returns batch* for more information.

7. Enter or select a vendor ID.

8. Enter a currency ID or accept the default entry. The default currency ID is the currency ID assigned to the vendor you selected. If no currency ID has been assigned for this vendor, the functional currency for the company will be used.

    The currency ID assigned to the return must match the currency ID of the receipts in the scrolling window.

    If the selected currency ID is not the functional currency for the company, a rate type and associated exchange rate table will be assigned to the transaction. The rate type is based on the rate type assigned to the selected vendor; if the vendor does not have a rate type assigned, the default rate type for the Purchasing series specified in the Multicurrency Setup window is used.

    For a Return w/Credit return, you can view or modify the default exchange rate by choosing the currency ID expansion button to open the Exchange Rate Entry window.

9. If the item being returned was purchased from an EU vendor, mark EU Transaction. See *Entering Intrastat trade statistics for returns* for more information.

10. You can enter or select the purchase order number applicable to this return. All purchase orders associated with the receipt number will be available in the PA Purchase Orders lookup window.

    Only standard purchase orders that have been received can be returned. You cannot process returns for drop-ship, canceled, or on-hold purchase orders.

11. Enter or select a project and cost category.

12. Enter or select the items to return using the item number from the vendor. All items previously received for the specified purchase order will be available in the lookup window.

    Non-inventoried items cannot be selected from the lookup window. However, you can return these by entering the item number.

    To add an attachment to the item, select the item and choose the Attachment Management icon to open the Document Attachment Management window.

13. Enter or select the receipt number applicable to this return.

    You must select an item, or a vendor item, before you can select the receipt number.

    The currency ID of the receipt you select must match the currency ID of the return document.

    If the receipt number that you enter is matched to more than one receipt line or inventory receipt line, a lookup window (Purchasing Returns PO Receipt Numbers) will open, where you can select the applicable receipt line. The Purchasing Returns PO Receipt Numbers lookup window displays the unit of measure from the original receipt, which may be different than the unit of measure in the Returns Transaction Entry window.

    If there are multiple invoice receipts attached to the receipt number you select, the Purchasing Returns PO Invoice Receipt Numbers lookup window will open, where you can select the applicable invoice receipt.

    If there are no quantities available for the receipt number that you entered, you will have the option to search for another receipt. If you choose Yes, a lookup window will open, where you can select another receipt with the same item.

    The only way to change a receipt number after it has been entered is to delete the return line and reenter the information.

14. Enter or accept the unit of measure.

15. Enter the quantity to be returned or accept the default entry.

    If you're using multiple bins, the total quantity selected for bins must equal the extended quantity of the line item.

16. Enter or accept the unit cost.

    The default entry for the unit cost of the item is based on the document type, as shown in the following table.<--!something wrong here-->

    | **Document type** | **Default unit cost**        |
    |-------------------|------------------------------|
    | Return w/Credit   | The original invoice receipt |

### Multiple bins in purchase order returns

Use multiple bins to add another level of detail to item quantity tracking. Besides tracking items within inventory sites, with multiple bins you can track item quantities in bins that reside within each site. Bin quantities are processed and displayed in the item's base unit of measure.

*You can set up bin information when multiple bins functionality has been installed and registered. However, you must also enable this feature in Inventory Control before you can use bins to track items. For more information about enabling multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation.*

Default bins for transaction types at each site can be identified for use in transactions. For example, a default bin could be created for return transactions at your warehouse site. Default bins also can be identified for a particular item and transaction type at a site. If you always use Bin A when returning a certain item from your main site, for example, you can set up Bin A as the default purchase purchase returns bin for the item at the main site. Microsoft Dynamics GP automatically creates item-site-bin relationships the first time a bin is used for a transaction.

If you're using multiple bins and a default purchase returns bin exists at either the item-site or the site, the quantity at the default bin will decrease by the extended quantity for an item that is not tracked by serial or lot numbers. You can modify the default bin selections. If a default purchase returns bin doesn't exist, you will be required to enter one. For serial- and lot-numbered items, the purchase returns bin is the bin associated with the serial or lot number and you won't be able to change the bin.

For more information about setting up and using multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation

### Changing bins for a return transaction

If you're using multiple bins, use the Bin Quantity Entry window to verify or change bin allocations for items that are not tracked by serial or lot numbers. For items that are tracked by serial or lot numbers, you can verify bins in the Purchasing Returns Serial Number Entry window or the Purchasing Returns Lot Number Entry window. For more information, see *Assigning lot numbers to a return* or *Assigning serial numbers to a return*.

You can select from more than one bin per site for an item that tracks serial or lot numbers. For example, if the quantity returned is 20, you can select 15 from Site A, Bin 1 and 5 from Site A, Bin 2.

**To change bins for a return transaction:**

1. Open the Returns Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry)

2. Enter document information, including return type, return number, vendor document number, date, and vendor ID.

3. Select a sales inventory or discontinued item that isn't tracked by serial or lot numbers and choose the Bins button to open the Bin Quantity Entry window.

4. From the list of available bins, select one to use. You also can enter a bin that hasn't been created yet.

### Processing manual adjustments for returns when closing purchase order lines

Some manual adjustments are required for Return type return documents based on the particular circumstances of that transaction. Purchase order lines are closed automatically when they are completely invoiced. If the returned item is not going to be replaced or if the replacement item will be received on a new purchase order, you must manually close the purchase order line. If the purchase order has been partially invoiced, the purchase receipt cost will be adjusted incorrectly. To correct this, you will need to manually adjust the inventory unit costs and create an adjusting journal entry.

> [!NOTE]
> If the returned item will be replaced, we recommend that you close the purchase order line after the non-returned items have been invoiced.

**To process manual adjustments for returns when closing purchase order lines:**

1. Open the Edit Purchase Orders window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Edit Purchase Orders)

2. Enter the purchase order number.

3. Change the purchase order line item status to Closed.

    For more information about editing purchase order status, refer to the Purchase Order Processing documentation.*

4. Use the posting journal and distribution breakdown registers to check the adjustment entries created by Purchase Order Processing when closing the purchase order.

5. If the purchase receipt cost has been adjusted incorrectly—this happens when the purchase order has been partially invoiced—adjust the Inventory Unit Cost using the Inventory Adjust Costs window (Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Adjust Costs).

    For more information about adjusting the purchase receipt cost of an item, refer to the Inventory Control documentation.

6. If necessary, create an adjusting journal entry to correct the accrued and the inventory accounts.

Refer to the General Ledger documentation for information about correcting General Ledger entries.

## Chapter 24: Taxes for returns

Taxes for returns with credit can be calculated, modified, and distributed in purchase order approvals. Taxes are calculated automatically when you leave the line in the Returns Transaction Entry window. Taxes for freight and miscellaneous are calculated automatically when you enter those fields. The total tax amount for the return is displayed in the Tax field.

If your system is set up to allow editing summary-level taxes, use the Returns Tax Summary Entry window to change tax distributions for returns. To change tax details or the tax distribution for individual line items, use the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

If your system is set up to specify tax details for automatic tax calculation, only those tax details that are marked in the Tax Schedule Maintenance window will be used to calculate taxes automatically.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Default tax schedules for return documents*

- *Calculating and distributing summary taxes for returns*

- *Default item tax schedules*

- *Default tax schedules for return items*

- *Calculating and distributing detail taxes for return line items*

- *Returns for Australia/New Zealand*

### Default tax schedules for return documents

The tax calculation option assigned in the Purchase Order Processing Setup window is used to determine which default tax schedule will be assigned to the return document. The shipping method assigned to the vendor's purchase address is checked as well to determine where the exchange of goods took place. Together the shipping method and the tax calculation option determine which tax schedule appears as a default tax schedule for the return document.

Refer to the following table for the default tax schedules for a return document.

| **Tax Calculation option** | **Shipping method**          | **Default tax schedule for the return**                                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single                     | Not applicable               | Single tax schedule assigned in the Purchase Order Processing Setup Options window |
| Advanced                   | Pickup OR No shipping method | Tax schedule assigned to the vendor's purchase address                             |
| Advanced                   | Delivery                     | Purchases tax schedule assigned in the Company Setup window                        |

*If you decided not to use the shipping method to determine the default tax schedule, the tax schedule assigned to the vendor's purchase address will be the default tax schedule no matter what tax calculation method you selected to use.*

### Calculating and distributing summary taxes for returns

Use the Returns Tax Summary Entry window to add, change, delete, or view summarized tax amounts and the posting accounts for a return. Taxes are calculated automatically as you enter each tax detail or edit the Total Returns amount. Summary tax edits won't change the taxes calculated for each line item in the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

If your system isn't set up to allow editing summary-level taxes, you can't change the tax amount in the Returns Transaction Entry window or the tax information in the Returns Tax Summary Entry window, except for the account.

If you are using Project Accounting, you can't change the tax amount in the Returns

Transaction Entry window or the tax information in the Returns Tax Summary Entry window for return and return with credit transactions even if your system is set up to allow editing summary-level taxes.

Regardless of how your system is set up, you will be able to change the account for tax included in item price taxes at the summary level. For more information on setup options, see the System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).

**To calculate and distribute summary taxes for returns:**

1. Open the Returns Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry)

2. Enter document information, including return type, return number, vendor document number, date, and vendor ID. You cannot enter tax information for returns without credit.

3. Enter or select the item to be returned and enter line item information.

4. Choose the Tax expansion button to open the Returns Tax Summary Entry window where you can view or edit the tax distribution amounts.

    ![screenshot Returns Tax Summary Entry](media/POage216.jpg)

    Currency amounts in this window may be displayed in the functional or originating currency depending on the view selected in the Returns Transaction Entry window.

5. To edit tax information, enter a tax detail ID, total returns, total taxable returns, tax amount, or select a new account. (The tax amount for the detail will be posted to the account).

    To delete a single tax detail, select the row containing it and choose Edit \>\> Delete Row. To delete all the tax distributions, choose Delete.

    To restore the default tax information, choose Default.

6. Continue entering tax details until the tax is fully distributed. See *Entering detail information for a return* for more information on entering these details.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To restore the default tax information, choose Default.

7. Choose OK to save your entries and return to the Returns Transaction Entry window.

If there is a difference between the total tax amount distributed to tax details and the tax amount entered in the Returns Transaction Entry window, the tax amount will be adjusted to match the total tax amount.

### Default item tax schedules

The Item Tax Schedule field on the detail view of the Returns Transaction Entry window displays the default tax schedule assigned to the item that is applicable to this return line. The item tax schedule that will be used depends on the return type and the tax calculation method assigned in Purchase Order Processing Setup Options window. Refer to the following table for the item tax schedule default values:

| **Return type**    | **Tax Calculation Option** | **Default item tax schedule**                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Return w/Credit OR | Single schedule            | None                                                      |
| Inventory w/Credit | Advanced                   | Purchase tax schedule assigned to the item in the Item    |
| Return w/Credit    | Advanced                   | Tax schedule assigned to the item on the original receipt |

### Default tax schedules for return items

When the Single Tax Calculation method is selected in Purchase Order Processing Setup Options window, tax is calculated for each individual return line based on the tax schedule assigned to the return document.

When the Advanced tax calculation method is selected in Purchase Order Processing Setup Options window, taxes are calculated for individual return lines based on the item taxable option as follows:

- When the item taxable option is Taxable, the item tax schedule IDs are masked against the tax schedule IDs assigned to the return line. Masking means that only tax details that exist in both schedules will be used.

- When the item taxable option is Nontaxable, no tax is calculated.

- When the item taxable option is Base on Vendor, the tax schedule IDs assigned to the return line will be used to calculate taxes.

Refer to the following table for the default tax schedules for return lines.

| **Return Type**    | **Tax Calculation option** | **Shipping Method** | **Default Tax Schedule**                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Return w/Credit or | Single                     | Not applicable      | Single tax schedule assigned in the Purchase Order Processing Setup |
| Return w/Credit    | Advanced                   | Not applicable      | Tax schedule assigned to the original purchase receipt              |
| Inventory w/Credit | Advanced                   | Pickup OR           | Tax schedule assigned to the return                                 |
| Inventory w/Credit | Advanced                   | Delivery            | Purchase tax schedule assigned to the site                          |

### Calculating and distributing detail taxes for return line items

Use the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window to add, change, delete, or view tax amounts calculated on an individual line item. Taxes are calculated automatically as you enter each tax detail or edit the Total Returns amount. Summary tax edits won't change the taxes calculated for each line item in the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window. However, tax edits made for each return line will change the summary tax amounts in the Returns Tax Summary Entry window.

**To calculate and distribute detail taxes for return line items:**

1. Open the Returns Transaction Entry window. (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry)

2. Enter document information, including return type, return number, vendor document number, date, and vendor ID. You cannot enter tax information for returns without credit.

3. Enter or select the item to be returned and enter line item information.

4. Enter a calculated tax amount or choose the Calculated Tax expansion button to open the Returns Line Item Tax Detail Entry window, where you can view or edit tax distribution amounts.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your system is set up to enable GST for Australia/New Zealand, you also can change the account.

5. To edit tax information, enter a tax detail ID, total returns or tax amount for the line item. (The tax amount for the detail will be posted to the account.) See *Entering detail information for a return* for more information on entering these details.

    To delete all the tax details, choose Delete.

    To delete a single tax detail, select the row containing it and choose Edit \>\> Delete Row. To delete all the tax distributions, choose Delete.

    To restore the default tax information, choose Default.

6. Choose OK to save your entries and return to the Returns Transaction Entry window.

If there is a difference between the total tax amount distributed to tax details and the calculated tax amount entered in the scrolling window of the Returns Transaction Entry window, the calculated tax amount will be adjusted to match the total tax amount distributed to tax details.

### Returns for Australia/New Zealand

If your system is set up to enable GST for Australia/New Zealand, you can indicate whether a tax invoice has been received for the return transaction. You also will be able to print a Recipient Created Adjustment Note from the Returns Batch Entry window or from the Returns Transaction Entry window.

### Indicating that a tax invoice has been received

The Returns Transaction Entry window displays Tax Invoice Received and Tax Invoice Required options for returns with credit when your system is set up to enable GST for Australia/New Zealand. The information from these options will be provided to the Tax Invoice Required and Tax Invoice Received reports available to you from the Tax Invoice Received window.

Use the Tax Invoice Received option to indicate whether a tax invoice has been received for this return transaction. For more information about the Tax Invoice Required and Tax Invoice Received reports, refer to the GST and Australian Taxes documentation.

**To indicate that a tax invoice has been received:**

1. Open the Returns Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry)

2. Enter document information, including return type, vendor document number, date, and vendor ID. You cannot enter tax information for returns without credit.

    If you enter a vendor who has the Tax Invoice Received option marked in the Vendor Maintenance Options window, the Tax Invoice Received option in this window will be marked.

3. Enter or select the item to be returned and enter line item information.

4. To indicate that a tax invoice has been received for this return, mark the Tax Invoice Received option.

    If the Tax Invoice Required option in the Tax Detail Maintenance window is marked for any tax detail for this transaction, the Tax Invoice Required option in this window will be marked.

5. Complete the return transaction as explained in *Processing purchasing return transactions* or in *Processing project return-from-inventory transactions*.

### Recipient Created Adjustment Note for Returns

An adjustment note shows the corrections made on the Business Activity Statement, which usually means the GST charges or input tax credits attributed to the statement are less or more than they should be. The report shows the same information printed in a tax invoice, with the transaction amount modified.

The following table lists the windows from which you can print an adjustment note.

| **Window**                                                                              | **Navigation** |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Returns Transaction Entry (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Transaction Entry) | Reports button |
| Reports Batch Entry (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Returns Batches)                 | Reports button |
