This part of the sales order processing documentation includes information that will help manage your sales documents once they are entered. You can transfer, modify, delete, post, and print sales documents. The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 24, "Printing and sending documents in email,"* describes how to print sales documents—quotes, orders, back orders, invoices, returns, picking tickets, and packing slips. It also explains how to print shipping labels and COD tags.

- *Chapter 26, "Posting,"* explains how to post an individual sales transaction or a batch of transactions.

- *Chapter 25, "Sales document maintenance,"* explains how to correct, delete, and void sales documents. It also explains process holds.

- *Chapter 27, "Transferring documents,"* explains how to transfer sales documents as a part of the sales cycle.

## Chapter 24: Printing and sending documents in email

After you enter a quote, order, fulfillment order, invoice, back order, or return, you can print the document and send it to a customer. You also can print packing slips, picking tickets, shipping labels, and cash on delivery (COD) tags.

- *Printing a batch list*

- *Printing shipping labels or COD tags*

### Packing slips and picking tickets overview

You can print packing slips for orders, fulfillment orders, and invoices and include them in each shipment. A packing slip displays the items and quantities included on an order or invoice. If items on an invoice have negative invoice quantities, those items will not be printed on the packing slip. If all the items on an invoice have a Services item type, a packing slip is not printed. If items on an invoice have Miscellaneous Charges or Flat Fee item type, a packing slip is printed. If an item on an invoice has a Kit item type and the kit has no items, a packing slip is not printed. See [Printing options for packing slips and picking tickets](#printing-options-for-packing-slips-and-picking-tickets) for printing more information.

You can print picking tickets for orders, fulfillment orders, invoices, and returns. Warehouse personnel use picking tickets when assembling the items for a shipment. A picking ticket displays the items and quantities needed to fulfill an order, fulfillment order, or invoice and the location for each item. A picking ticket for a return displays the items and quantities returned and the site they were returned to. If you reprint a picking ticket, the words REPRINT will be displayed across the top of the report. Items will not be printed on the picking ticket if they are drop-ship items, have negative invoice quantities, or have zero quantities. See [Printing options for packing slips and picking tickets](#printing-options-for-packing-slips-and-picking-tickets) for more information.

You can print bulk picking tickets for fulfillment orders and invoices created from fulfillment orders. A bulk picking ticket displays the items and quantities needed to fulfill more than one fulfillment order or invoice and the location of each item for a batch of items. A summary line for each item and the total quantity required is displayed on the picking ticket. If you print a bulk picking ticket and then an individual picking ticket, items displayed on both picking tickets will be displayed with two asterisks (\*\*) and a reprint icon.

You can print packing slips and picking tickets at the same time you print the sales document and can use three predefined document formats—blank paper, short form, or long form. A separate packing slip will be printed for each unique ship-to address and shipping method combination on a sales document.

You can define a default document format when you set up **Sales Order Processing** and you can change the format before you print a document. For more information about setting up default document formats, see [Setting up document numbers](sales-order-processing.md#setting-up-document-numbers) or [Chapter 3: Document setup](sales-order-processing.md#chapter-3-document-setup).

If you assigned a print process hold to an order, invoice, or return, this process hold also applies to the picking ticket and packing slip associated with the sales document.

### Printing options for packing slips and picking tickets

Depending on the document you print, different printing options will be available. You can print packing slips or picking tickets at the same time as you print sales documents.

## Chapter 25: Sales document maintenance

Before you transfer or post a document, you can modify the item, commission, and total information. For example, you can change quantities, add items, correct addresses, split commissions, or add freight charges. If the document was entered in error, you can void or delete the document. You also can assign a process hold to a document to prevent it from being processed further.

If you are entering transactions for customers who are part of a national account, changing the hold or inactive status can be at an individual customer level or across the national account. If you can't enter a transaction for a customer ID, check the status of the Apply Hold/Inactive Status of Parent Across National Account option in the National Accounts Maintenance window.

### Modifying an existing sales document

You can add items, delete items, or change item quantities on a sales document. You also can increase the item quantity on items that have been transferred.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't modify an invoice or return that has been posted. If you discover a mistake after posting a document, you'll need to enter a transaction to reverse the original transaction. For example, enter a return to reverse an invoice.

If you are using sales quote workflow or customer credit limit override workflow, you can't modify a quote, order, fulfillment order, or invoice that is pending approval. You can modify a document that is pending approval if you are the current approver of the document. You must resubmit a quote, order, fulfillment order, or invoice after modifying an approved document or a document that doesn't need approval.

#### To modify an existing sales document

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Sales button, and then choose the Sales Order Transactions list.

2. Select a sales document to edit.

3. In the Modify group, choose Edit to open the Sales Transaction Entry window.

4. Highlight the item to change and enter the correct information.

    If documents are set up to be allocated by document or batch, additional items entered on the document after you have allocated the document will be allocated by line and you must address each quantity shortage that arises.

    If you decrease a Quantity to Back Order or a Quantity Canceled on a document, the item won't be reallocated automatically. The Quantity Alert icon will appear next to the quantity and you'll have to allocate the quantity again. For more information about allocation, see *Chapter 19, "Allocating item quantities."*

    > [!NOTE]
    > To delete an item, highlight the item and choose Edit \>\> Delete Row. You can't delete an item that has been transferred to another document.

5. Save the document.

You might have to resubmit a quote, if you are using sales quote workflow.

If the document exceeds the customer's credit limit and you are using customer credit limit override workflow, you can submit the document for approval.

### Adding a comment to sales documents

You can add comments to sales documents—quotes, orders, back orders, invoices, or returns—or to individual line items on a sales document. These comments can be printed on sales documents, including picking tickets and packing slips. Comments can be predefined on a company-wide basis, and used on Sales Order Processing, Invoicing, or Purchase Order Processing documents. You can enter the ID of a predefined comment in the Sales Transaction Entry or Sales Item Detail Entry windows.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enter up to 200 characters, which will appear on the sales document as four lines of 50 characters each. If you want longer comments to appear, use Report Writer to modify the document layout.

You can create new comments while you are entering transactions. You can also create custom comments for a particular document or line item, or modify existing comments. One-time comments or modified comments won't be available for other documents or line items.

For serial- or lot-numbered items, you can verify or change bins in the Sales Serial Number Entry window or the Sales Lot Number Entry window. For more information, see *Changing a serial or lot number*.

You can select more than one bin per site. For example, if the quantity fulfilled is 20, you can select 15 from Site A, Bin 1 and 5 from Site A, Bin 2. You may be required to change bin selections manually if you change quantities, the unit of measure, or the site after bins have been selected.

#### To change bins in Sales Order Processing

1. Open the Sales Transaction Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Transaction Entry)

2. Select an item and choose the Quantity Fulfilled expansion button.

    For items not tracked by serial or lot numbers, the Bin Quantity Entry window will open. For serial- or lot-numbered items, the Sales Serial Number Entry window or Sales Lot Number Entry window will open.

    You can also select an item and choose the item expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window. Choose Bins for an item not tracked by serial or lot numbers. For serial- or lot-numbered items also tracked in bins, choose Serial/Lot.

### Advancing the document status of a fulfillment order

As you complete each step in your sales fulfillment workflow process, such as printing picking tickets, picking items, and printing packing slips, you should advance the document status for a fulfillment order to the next tracked status. Use the Sales Transaction Entry window or the Sales Order Fulfillment window to advance the document status of a fulfillment order.

For more information about the document statuses, refer to *Setting up fulfillment workflow for sales*.

#### To advance the document status of a fulfillment order

1. Open the Sales Transaction Entry window or the Sales Order Fulfillment window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Transaction Entry or Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Order Fulfillment)

2. Enter or select a fulfillment order.

3. If you're tracking document Status 1, you can choose the printer button to print the picking ticket and advance the document status from Status 1 to the next document status that you're tracking.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must print a bulk picking ticket before you can print an individual picking ticket with one or more line items that print only on bulk picking tickets.

    If you're tracking document Status 2, you can choose Confirm \>\> Pick to advance the document status from Status 2 to the next document status that you're tracking.

    If you're tracking document Status 3, you can choose the printer button to print the packing slip and advance the document status from Status 3 to the next document status that you're tracking.

    If you're tracking document Status 4, you can choose Confirm \>\> Pack to advance the document status from Status 4 to the next document status that you're tracking.

    If you're tracking document Status 5, you can choose Confirm \>\> Ship to advance the document status from Status 5 to Status 6. The fulfillment order will become an invoice.

4. Choose Save.

### Advancing the document status of one or more fulfillment orders

Typically, a document status will advance to the next tracked status as you complete each step in the sales fulfillment workflow process. Occasionally, however, you might need to advance the status of a document outside of the sales fulfillment workflow process.

For example, suppose you're tracking all six document statuses and you printed picking tickets for multiple fulfillment orders. The delivery truck arrives early to pick up the orders, so you pack the picking tickets and send them with the orders. You can advance the document status for multiple documents from 2 to 5, one status at a time, to update the fulfillment order document status.

Use the Sales Bulk Confirmation window to advance the status of one or more fulfillment orders to Status 3, 4, 5, or 6.

If you are using customer credit limit override workflow, the fulfillment orders must be approved or the fulfillment order must not need approval to advance the document status. You can advance the document status if the fulfillment order is pending approval and you are the current approver of the order.

#### To advance the document status of one or more fulfillment orders

1. Open the Sales Bulk Confirmation window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Bulk Confirmation)

    ![Bulk Confirmation](media/SOage173.jpg)

2. Select the action to complete. The actions available will depend on the statuses you selected to track in the Sales Fulfillment Document Workflow Setup window, and can include the following actions.

    - Confirm Pick

    - Print Packing Slip

    - Confirm Pack

    - Confirm Ship

3. To restrict the information displayed in this window, select the appropriate option and enter or select the starting and ending ranges.

4. Choose Redisplay. The documents that match your selections will be displayed in the scrolling window.

5. Documents that are marked will be processed. You can unmark specific documents or choose Unmark All.

    To print packing slips, choose the printer button.

7. Close the window.

### Assigning process holds to a document

You can assign process holds to individual documents. Process holds are userdefined restrictions that control the processing of sales documents at different stages of the sales cycle. You can use process holds to restrict the transfer, fulfillment, printing, or posting of a document. Process holds assigned to an order, invoice, or return also apply to the picking ticket and packing slip associated with the document.

If you are using sales quote workflow, you can't apply a hold for a quote that is pending approval.

If you are using customer credit limit override workflow, you can apply a hold to an order, fulfillment order, or invoice that doesn't require approval or that has been approved. You can't apply a hold for an order, fulfillment order, or invoice that is pending approval unless you can approve the document.

If you're using sales fulfillment workflow, you also can use process holds to restrict the advancement of a document status of a fulfillment order.

You must set up process holds in Sales Order Processing before they can be assigned to a document. For more information about setting up process holds, see *Setting up process holds*.

A process hold also can be assigned to a document ID when you set it up. For more information about assigning process holds to a document ID, see *Assigning process holds to sales document IDs*.

A record of removal is stored with each document, along with the user ID of the user who removed the hold and the date and time it was removed. You can view this record in the Sales Process Holds Entry window.

### Reversing the document status of fulfillment orders

If you're using sales fulfillment workflow, use the Edit Sales Document Status window to reverse the document status of fulfillment orders. You can move the document status back one status at a time. For example, suppose you printed a picking ticket for a customer order—but had not confirmed the pick—and the customer called to add an item to the order. You could reverse the document status from Status 2 to Status 1, and then continue with the regular process. You cannot reverse a document status when the fulfillment order document has become an invoice and the document status is Status 6.

Reversing document statuses does not back out quantity fulfilled or quantity allocated values.

3. Choose Delete.

## Chapter 26: Posting

Posting is the process of transferring unposted transactions to permanent records and updating accounts with specific transaction amounts. When you enter transactions, they are stored. Until transactions are posted, they can be changed, voided, or deleted. When you post transactions in Sales Order Processing, they are transferred to history and can't be changed or voided.

Posting reports will be printed when you post transactions, either individually or in batches. For more information about posting reports for Sales Order Processing, refer to *Sales Order Processing report summary*.

For more information about setting up posting, see the System Setup Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Posting overview for Sales Order Processing*

- *Posting a single transaction*

- *Posting a single batch*

### Posting overview for Sales Order Processing

When you post a batch in Sales Order Processing, the invoices and returns are posted, moved to history and removed from the batch. Quotes, orders, or back orders will remain in batches until you void, delete, or transfer them to another document.

When you post an invoice or return in Sales Order Processing, the following transactions and records will be updated:

- Inventory quantities will be adjusted for the items sold or returned.

- If you're using multiple bins, the item's on-hand quantity and allocated quantity decrease in each bin at the site when you post an invoice.

- If you're using multiple bins and you post a return, bin quantities increase by the quantity specified in the Sales Returned Quantities Entry window.

- The customer balance and salesperson commission will be updated in Receivables Management. A transaction will be added in Receivables Management so you can apply payments to the documents.

- Sales tax records will be updated for the transaction.

- If you're using Bank Reconciliation, your checkbook will be updated if the transaction has an amount received or returned.

- Transactions will be posted to or through General Ledger, depending on how your system is set up. For more information about setting up posting options, see the System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).

> [!NOTE]
> National accounts provide the ability to restrict payments for child customers and apply credit checking, holds and finance charges at a consolidated national account level, depending on how the account was set up. If you can't save or post a transaction, check the status of the options in the National Accounts Maintenance window.

### Posting a single transaction

After you enter a sales invoice or return, you can post the document or save it to a batch. For more information about entering invoices or returns, see *Entering an invoice* or *Entering a return*. You must approve invoices that exceeded the customer's credit limit if you are usingcustomer credit limit override workflow.

#### To post a single transaction

1. Open the Sales Transaction Entry window.
 (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Transaction Entry)

2. Select or enter the sales transaction information. To enter and post a single transaction, don't enter a batch ID. If you select an existing transaction, clear the Batch ID field.

3. Choose Post to post the transaction.

4. Close the window and select which posting reports to print.

> [!NOTE]
> When transactions are posted using transaction-level posting, the batch control fields on the posting journal always contain zero amounts. The transactions have been posted, however, even though zeros are displayed. If the transactions hadn't been posted, a message would appear on the posting journal.

#### To post a single transaction using the action pane

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Sales button, and then choose the Sales Order Transactions list.

2. Mark the invoice or return that you want to post.

3. In the Adv. Distribution group or Actions group, choose Post.

4. Post the transaction and select which posting reports to print.

### Posting a single batch

Batch-level posting is one method of posting transactions. Within batch- level posting, there are three types—batch, series, and master. The only difference among these posting types is the number and types of batches you post at once.

Batch and series posting are explained in the following procedures. For information about master posting, refer to the System User's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Using the System).

You can use the Sales Batch Entry window to post a single batch. More than one person can enter transactions in the same batch; however, a batch can't be posted if anyone is making changes to it.
 When you post a batch, your Receivables Management records will be updated to reflect the information from the transactions. Your General Ledger accounts will be updated, depending on your posting setup selections.

- If your system is set up to post to General Ledger, the batch will appear in the Financial Series Posting and Master Posting windows. You can edit the transactions in the General Ledger Transaction Entry window before posting them again. Your accounts will be updated when you post the transactions in General Ledger.

- If your system is set up to post through General Ledger, your accounts will be updated at once and you won't need to post the batch again in General Ledger.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If there are batch total or batch approval requirements in Sales Order Processing and you post a batch through General Ledger, the batch will be posted through General Ledger regardless of the batch requirements in General Ledger.

Before you post a batch you should:

- Print an edit list and review the transactions in the batch. When you choose to print an edit list, the Sales Document Print Options window opens where you select to print an edit list. If you need to make corrections to the transactions or the batch, do so at this time. For more information about printing an edit list, see the System Setup Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).

- Make a backup of your company's data. Refer to the System Administrator's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select System Administration) for more information about making backups.

- Approve invoices that exceeded the customer's credit limit if you are using customer credit limit override workflow.

#### To post a single batch

1. Open the Sales Batch Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Batches)

2. Enter or select the batch ID and origin for the batch.

3. Approve the batch for posting, if required. Once approved, a batch can't be edited unless you unmark Approved.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once a batch containing recurring documents has been posted, the status automatically will become Unapproved. If you want to post the recurring documents again, you must approve the batch again before posting it.

4. Choose Post. One or more posting journals will be printed, depending on how your system is set up. A Report Destination window might appear for each posting journal that is printed.

If you're verifying batch totals and post a batch that contains erroneous transactions, the control totals will be adjusted to reflect the transactions that weren't posted. Any transactions that contain errors will remain in the batch after posting is complete. The actual number of transactions in the batch will be recalculated and the control total will become zero. After you've corrected the transaction, you'll need to enter a new control total and post again.

## Chapter 27: Transferring documents

You can transfer customer and item information from an existing document to a newly created document of another type. For example, if a customer decides to place an order based on a quote you provided, you can transfer the information from the existing quote to a new order. You don't have to reenter the information.

The following document types can be transferred:

| **Document type**  | **Transfer to**          |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Quotes             | Orders and invoices      |
| Orders             | Invoices and back orders |
| Fulfillment Orders | Back orders              |
| Invoices           | Back orders              |
| Back orders        | Orders and invoices      |

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Multicurrency and transfers*

- *Transfers and setup*

- *Transferring totals, deposits, and payments*

- *Quantity transfers*

- *Document attachments and transfers*

- *Transferring an individual sales document*

- *Transferring a batch of sales documents*

- *Transferring orders and back orders to invoices*

### Multicurrency and transfers

If Sales Order Processing is set up to search for new exchange rates during transfer, the system will use the exchange rate table to determine if a valid exchange rate is available.

If Sales Order Processing is not set up to search for new rates, the existing exchange rate for the document will be used when it is transferred.

Regardless of how Sales Order Processing was set up, the document date of the new document will be compared to the expiration date of the exchange rate. If you're transferring the document to an invoice, the posting date also will be compared to the expiration date of the exchange rate. If a valid exchange rate can't be found or if the rate has expired, you can still transfer the document but the transaction can't be posted until you enter a valid exchange rate. A message regarding the expired rate will appear on the Sales Transfer Log.

The only exceptions to this setup option is if the document has a deposit, the system won't search for a new rate, regardless of how Sales Order Processing is set up. If the exchange rate has expired, you still can transfer the document and the date for the exchange rate will be set to 00/00/00. This allows you to post the transaction to General Ledger and Sales Order Processing.

### Transfers and setup

When you transfer a document in Sales Order Processing, several setup options for the document type ID are verified to determine if the transfer can be completed and whether the items on the document will be allocated and fulfilled.

When you set up a type ID in Sales Order Processing setup for a quote, order, fulfillment order, invoice, or back order, you can select the document types and type IDs the document will be transferred to. You can choose the document expansion button in the Sales Transaction Entry window to check the document types that will be used when a document is transferred.

For example, if you set up a quote type and mark Transfer to Order and Transfer to Invoice, you can transfer documents with that quote type to invoices and orders. You also can select the order type and invoice type used for the new documents. If you marked only Transfer to Invoice, you can't transfer the quote to an order.

The Allocate By fields for order and invoice types also is checked. If this option is set to None, the item won't be allocated on the original document. When you transfer the document, the Allocate By option for the new document type will be used to determine if the item should be allocated and checked for shortages.

For more information about setting up type IDs, refer to *Chapter 3, "Document setup."*

### Transferring totals, deposits, and payments

When you transfer a document, you can mark Include Totals and Deposits in the Sales Transfer Entry window to transfer the deposits, freight, and miscellaneous charges to the new document.
 **Deposits** If you receive a deposit before you ship an order, you can transfer the deposit to the invoice or back order. If you partially transfer the order, you can transfer more than one deposit. For example, you can enter a sales order and transfer a deposit and some of the items to an invoice. When you are ready to ship the remaining items, you can enter a second deposit and transfer the remaining items and the second received amount to a second invoice. You can't transfer partial deposit amounts.

If you transfer all of the quantities on the document and don't mark Include Totals and Deposits, the deposit will remain on the original document. You can't transfer just the deposit. The only way to move just the deposit is to delete it on the order and enter it on the new document.

- **Payments** If you receive a credit card payment before you ship an order, you can transfer the payment to the invoice or back order. If you partially transfer the order, you can transfer more than one payment. For example, you can enter a sales order and transfer a payment and some of the items to an invoice. When you are ready to ship the remaining items, you can enter a second payment and transfer the remaining items and the second received amount to a second invoice.
    Deposit amounts are considered before payments during transfer. Payments over the invoice amount will be partially transferred or not transferred at all. You can't transfer a payment greater than the invoice amount.
     Payments will be transferred regardless of whether you mark Include Totals and Deposits. You can't transfer just the payment. The only way to move just the payment is to delete it on the order and enter it on the new document.
- **Freight and miscellaneous charges** You can transfer freight and miscellaneous charges only once. If you transfer part of a document, the freight and miscellaneous charges will be transferred, as well. When you transfer the remaining line items, freight, and miscellaneous charges can't be changed or transferred again.
- **Taxes** Taxes will be calculated automatically as you enter items. If you make changes to the tax information in the Sales Tax Summary Entry window, the changes will be transferred to the new document if the document is transferred in full.
    If the order is partially transferred, the taxes will be recalculated and any changes made to tax details will not be transferred to the new document. You must reenter the changes on the new back order or invoice created during the transfer.
- **Trade discounts** Trade discounts are transferred differently depending on whether you offer a discount based on a percentage or amount.

  - Trade discounts based on a percentage of the total are transferred each time
    you transfer the document, regardless of the option to include totals.

  - Trade discounts based on a flat amount rather than a percentage of the total are transferred only once if you've marked the option to include totals and deposits.

### Quantity transfers

When you choose Transfer in the Sales Transaction Entry or Sales Batch Entry window, each document will be transferred to the transfer document types you specified for the document type ID. The new documents will be created if you entered quantities on the original document.

For example, suppose you transfer a quote to both an invoice and an order. The amount you entered for the Quantity to Order field on the quote becomes the Quantity Ordered on the new order. The amount entered for the Quantity to Invoice on the quote becomes the Invoice Quantity on the new invoice.

> [!NOTE]
> The user date will be the document date for the new documents that are created.

The following example illustrates how the order and invoice are created.<!--something wrong here-->

**New order**
 Quantity ordered: 2
 Quantity to invoice: 2

| **Original quote** |
|--------------------|

 Quantity quoted: 10
 Quantity to invoice: 8
 Quantity to order: 2
 **New invoice**
 Invoice quantity: 8
 Billed quantity: 8
 **Total quantity transfers**
 You can transfer some or all of the quantities on a sales document. The following table describes what happens when you transfer all quantities on a document.

| **Type**    | **Action**   |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Quotes      | Individual quotes will be moved to history once the transfer is complete if you marked the option to maintain history in the Sales Order Processing Setup window. If you aren't maintaining history, the quote will be deleted.     |
| Orders      | Individual orders will be moved to history once all of the lines items have been transferred if you marked the option to maintain history in the Sales Order Processing Setup window. If you aren't maintaining history, the order will be deleted. Repeating orders are moved to history when the documents have been transferred the specified number of times. |
| Back Orders | Individual back orders will be moved to history once all line items are transferred if you marked the option to maintain history in the Sales Order Processing Setup window. If you aren't maintaining history, the back order will be deleted.   |

Repeating quotes are moved to history when the documents have been transferred the specified number of times.

### Partial quantity transfers

If you transfer only some of the line item quantities, the original document won't be removed and the amounts in the quantity fields in the original document will be updated to reflect the transfer. In addition, the amount in the Previously Invoiced field in the Sales Quantity Status window will be updated for each line item.

For example, a customer orders 10 answering machines. He wants 6 this week but can wait for the other 4. You enter the following amounts in the Sales Transaction Entry window:

- Order Quantity 10

- Quantity to Invoice 6

- Quantity to Back Order 4

After transferring the order to an invoice, the order has the remaining quantities:

- Order Quantity 10

- Quantity to Invoice 0

- Quantity to Back Order 4

Even though the Order Quantity is still 10, the system tracks the quantities that have been transferred and the quantity remaining to be transferred is 4.

> [!NOTE]
> Non-repeating quotes can be transferred only once. If you transfer some of the line item quantities, the quote is moved to history and you won't be able to transfer the remaining quantities.

The line item information icon will appear next to the item because the Quantity to Back Order of 4 hasn't been transferred to a back order document. You will need to cancel, back order, or invoice the remaining quantities.

You can choose the line item information button to open the Sales Quantity Status window and view information about the selected item, such as the quantities remaining and quantities canceled. You can use the Sales Quantity Status window to view the status of items if you've partially transferred a document or need to know if the item has been allocated.

Partial line item quantities aren't transferred if the customer doesn't accept partial shipments. To allow partial shipments, unmark the Ship Complete Document option in the Sales Customer Detail Entry window.

### Document attachments and transfers

When you choose Transfer in the Sales Transaction Entry or Sales Batch Entry window, attachments assigned to a document will be transferred to the transfer document types you specified for the document type ID. Attachments assigned to line items of a document will be transferred to the line items for the new document type.

For example, a quote has two line items. The quote has an attachment and each line item has an attachment. When you transfer the second line item of the quote to an order, the attachment assigned to the quote is transferred to the order and the attachment assigned to the second line item of the quote is transferred to the line item of the order.

When the first item from the quote is transferred to a different order, the attachment assigned to the quote is transferred to the new order and the attachment assigned to the first line item of the quote is transferred to the line item of the new order

### Transferring an individual sales document

Use the Sales Transfer Documents window to transfer item quantities from an existing document to a newly created document of another type. You can include totals and deposit information, which includes the freight and miscellaneous charges, when the document is transferred.

If the exchange rate for a transaction has expired, you can't post the new document. You must enter or select a valid exchange rate for the document in the Exchange Rate Maintenance window. For more information about exchange rates, see *Chapter 8, "Multicurrency transactions."*

Before a you transfer a document, you must:

- Verify that there are quantities to transfer to an order, invoice, or back order.

- Verify that the appropriate transfer options are marked for the type ID in sales setup.

- Enter a batch ID for the document.

- Approve the document, if required, if you are using sales quote workflow or customer credit limit override workflow.

A document with partial quantities won't be transferred if the Ship Complete Document option is marked in the Sales Customer Detail Entry window. If a document with the Ship Complete Document Option marked has a line item that is discontinued and a quantity shortage is overridden, the quantity of the line item that can't be allocated will be cancelled when the batch is transferred.

If you're using multiple bins, quantities are allocated at a default sales order fulfillment bin for sales line items. If you're using multiple bins and serial or lot numbers are assigned to an item on a transaction, the bins for the selected serial or lot numbers will be assigned to the transaction automatically.

If you're using multiple bins and the default sales order fulfillment bin is not found or has a quantity shortage, you will be required to select additional bins. If you continue the transfer without selecting additional bins, the line item's quantity fulfilled will be adjusted to equal the total quantity selected at the default bin.

#### To transfer an individual document

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Sales button, and then choose the Sales Order Transactions list.

2. Select a document to transfer.

3. In the Actions group, choose Transfer to open the Sales Transfer Documents window.

    ![Sales Transfer Documents window](media/SOage184.jpg)

4. Select transfer options. The transfer options are limited to the document type that was displayed in the Sales Transaction Entry window.

5. Specify quantity shortage options. The default quantity shortage options in the Sales Transfer Documents window will be used when transferring a single document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select Back Order All or Back Order Balance, the back order for these quantities won't be created when you transfer the original document. You must open the new document and transfer the back ordered quantity to a back order.

    You also can select how to process item quantity shortages for kit items. For more information about quantity shortage options, see *Chapter 19, "Allocating item quantities."*

6. Choose Preview to open the Sales Preview Transfer Quantities window to view the quantities that will be transferred to the different document types.

7. Choose Transfer to transfer the document. The Sales Transfer Log will be printed and any errors encountered during the transfer process can be reviewed using this report. The newly created document will be displayed in the Sales Transaction Entry window.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are transferring a document for a customer who is part of a national account, credit checking and hold or inactive status can be done at an individual customer level or across the national account. If you can't transfer a document, check the status of the options in the National Accounts Maintenance window.

### Transferring a batch of sales documents

You can transfer an entire batch of documents to new documents using the Sales Transfer Documents window. A batch can contain any combination of quotes, orders, invoices, back orders, and returns. You can transfer one type of document or all documents using this window. You can include totals and deposit information, which includes freight and miscellaneous charges, when the document is transferred.

If you are using sales quote workflow, quotes must be approved or they won't be transferred. If you are using customer credit limit override workflow, orders, fulfillment orders, and invoices must be approved or they won't be transferred. You can transfer documents that don't need approval.

When you transfer a batch, the new documents will be stored in the same batch as the original documents. You can transfer individual documents to a new batch by choosing the Document Number expansion button to open the Sales Document Detail Entry window and assigning a new batch ID. The documents will be assigned to the new batch when the transfer is complete.

The Customer Payment Summary Inquiry window and the Customer Summary window will be updated immediately to reflect deposit amounts that are transferred to invoices. Payment amounts won't be updated until invoices are posted.

If the exchange rate for a transaction has expired, you can't post the new document. You must enter or select a valid exchange rate for the document in the Exchange Rate Maintenance window. For more information about exchange rates, see *Chapter 8, "Multicurrency transactions."*

A document with partial quantities won't be transferred if the Ship Complete Document option is marked in the Sales Customer Detail Entry window. If a document with the Ship Complete Document Option marked has a line item that is discontinued and the quantity shortage is overridden, the quantity of the line item that can't be allocated will be cancelled when the batch is transferred.

If you're using multiple bins, quantities are allocated at a default sales order fulfillment bin for sales line items. If a default sales order fulfillment bin is not found, quantities will not be automatically allocated at a bin, and the line item will have a quantity fulfilled of zero. The transfer will continue and the Sales Transfer Log will indicate that bins must be manually selected.

If you're using multiple bins and serial or lot numbers are assigned to an item on a transaction, the bins for the selected serial or lot numbers will be assigned to the transaction automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are transferring documents for customers who are part of a national account, credit checking and hold or inactive status can be done at an individual customer level or across the national account. If you can't transfer a document, check the status of the options in the National Accounts Maintenance window.

#### To transfer a batch of sales documents

1. Open the Sales Batch Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Batches)

2. Select a batch to transfer and choose Transfer. The Sales Transfer Documents window will open.

    ![Sales Transfer Documents window transfers](media/SOage184.jpg)

3. Select transfer options. The transfer options are not limited to the document types contained in the batch.

4. Specify quantity shortage options.

     If you choose to transfer a batch of documents, you must decide what to do with quantity shortages before the new documents are created. The option you select will be used for all quantity shortages in the batch.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you mark Back Order All or Back Order Balance, the back order for these quantities won't be created when you transfer the original document. You must open the new document and transfer it to a back order.

    You also can select how to process item quantity shortages for kit items. For more information about quantity shortage options, see *Chapter 19, "Allocating item quantities."*

5. Choose Preview to open the Sales Preview Transfer Quantities window to view the quantities that will be transferred to the different document types.

6. Choose Transfer to transfer the document. The Sales Transfer Log will be printed and any errors encountered during the transfer process can be reviewed using this report.

### Transferring orders and back orders to invoices

If you're using sales fulfillment workflow, use the Sales Multiple Orders to Invoices Transfer window to transfer orders and back orders to invoices. Instead of transferring one document at a time, you can transfer groups of documents with the same characteristics, such as batch ID, customer ID, or requested ship date. A separate invoice is created for each order or back order. You also can choose how to handle item quantity shortages and kit quantity shortages.

If you are using customer credit limit override workflow, orders that exceed the customer's credit limit won't be transferred if they aren't approved. You can transfer orders that don't need approval.

#### To transfer orders and back orders to invoices

1. Open the Sales Multiple Orders to Invoices Transfer window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Transfer Multiple Orders)

    ![Sales Multiple Orders to Invoices Transfer window](media/SOage187.jpg)

2. Mark to transfer Orders, Back Orders, or both.

3. Enter a batch ID to transfer the orders and back orders into.

4. Select options for when there is an item quantity shortage or a kit quantity shortage.

5. Enter or select a range of documents to transfer.

6. Choose Insert to display the range of documents in the restrictions list.

7. Choose Transfer and close the window. The Sales Transfer Log will be printed.
