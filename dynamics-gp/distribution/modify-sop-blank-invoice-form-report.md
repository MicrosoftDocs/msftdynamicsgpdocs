## Create the calculated fields to display more than four comments

In this section, you learn how to modify the **SOP Blank Invoice Form** report to display more than four line item comments.

1. Start **Report Writer**. To do this, choose **Tools**, point to **Customize**, and then choose **Report Writer**.

2. Choose **Microsoft Dynamics GP** in the **Product** list.

3. Choose **Reports**.

4. In the **Original Reports** list, choose **SOP Blank Invoice Form**, and then choose **Insert**.

5. In the **Modified Reports** list, choose **SOP Blank Invoice Form**, and then choose **Open**.

6. In the **Report Definition** window, choose **Layout**.

7. In the **Toolbox** window, choose **Calculated Fields** in the **Resources** list, and then choose **New**.

8. In the **Calculated Field Definition** window, type *LINE COMMENT1* in the **Name** box.

9. In the **Result Type** list, choose `String`.

10. In the **Expression Type** box, choose **Calculated**.

11. Choose the **Functions** tab, and then choose **User-Defined**.

12. In the **Core** list, choose **System**.

13. In the **Function** list, choose `RW\_SOPLINECommentText`, and then choose **Add**.

14. Choose the **Fields** tab, and then choose **Sales Line Comment Work and History** in the **Resources** list.

15. In the **Field** list, choose **SOP Type**, and then choose **Add**.

16. In the **Field** list, choose **SOP Number**, and then choose **Add**.

17. In the **Field** list, choose **Line Item Sequence**, and then choose **Add**.

18. In the **Field** list, choose **Component Sequence**, and then choose **Add**.

19. Choose the **Constants** tab, and then choose **Integer** in the **Type** list.

20. In the **Constant** field, type **80** , and then choose Add.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The number that you type is the maximum character length of the calculated field that can be printed in Report Writer. You can use a smaller value if you do not require 80 characters.

21. In the **Constant** field, type *1* , and then choose **Add**.

22. Verify that the expression in the Calculated field appears as the following string:

    ```
    FUNCTION\_SCRIPT(RW\_SOPLINECommentText SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.SOP Type SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.SOP Number SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.Line Item Sequence SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.Component Sequence 80 1) **Note** This expression refers to the first line item comment, LINE COMMENT1. To display the other comment lines, you can repeat step 6 through step 20 to create additional calculated fields. When you create these additional calculated fields, you must change the values that you typed in step 7 and in step 20. For example, when you create a calculated field for the second comment line, you must type "LINE COMMENT2" in step 7. You must type "2" in step 20. When you create a calculated field for the third line item comment, you must type "LINE COMMENT3" in step 7. You must type "3" in step 20. Therefore, the expression of the calculated field for the second line item comment must resemble the following string:FUNCTION\_SCRIPT(RW\_SOPLINECommentText SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.SOP Type SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.SOP Number SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.Line Item Sequence SOP\_LINE\_CMT\_WORK\_HIST.Component Sequence 80 2)
    ```
23. Choose **OK**.

24. In the **Report Footer** section of the report, set the visibility of the existing comment fields (labeled *Comment 1* to *Comment 4*) to invisible. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. Double-choose each comment field to open the **Report Field Options** window.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You also can choose **Field options** on the **Tools** menu for each field to open the **Report Field Options** window.

    2. In the **Visibility** field of each comment field, choose **Invisible**.

    3. Choose **OK**.

54. Drag the calculated fields that you created in the Toolbox dialog box to the Report Footer section over the existing comment fields.

26. If you created more than four calculated fields for line item comments, drag the additional comment fields in the Toolbox dialog box to the F2 - Comment 4 section. To expand this section to make room for the additional calculated fields, choose the F2 box, and then drag down the F2 box.

27. Double-choose each field that is added, and then make sure that the display type is Last Occurrence for each field.
