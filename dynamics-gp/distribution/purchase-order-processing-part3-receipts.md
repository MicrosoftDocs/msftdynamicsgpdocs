# Purchase Order Processing Part 3: Receipts

This part of the documentation explains how to enter and manage receipts. The data entry windows were designed to resemble actual receipt documents, with vendor, line item, and totals information. Receipts can be saved, edited if necessary, and then posted so that they become part of your permanent accounting records. Posting receipts also updates inventory quantities. If your system includes General Ledger, you can update the balances of your posting accounts, as well.

Following is a list of topics that are discussed:

- *Chapter 12, "Receipt batches,"* explains how to use batches to group purchasing documents for posting.

- *Chapter 13, "Shipment and in-transit inventory receipt entry,"* describes how to enter shipment, shipment/invoice, and in-transit inventory receipts.

- *Chapter 14, "Shipment receipt entry for projects,"* describes how to enter shipment and shipment/invoice receipts for projects.

- *Chapter 15, "Shipment receipt detail entry,"* describes how to enter detailed information about a document, line item, or other elements of a transaction.

- *Chapter 16, "Invoice receipt entry,"* explains how to enter invoice receipts and match them to shipment receipts.

- *Chapter 17, "Invoice receipt entry for projects,"* explains how to enter invoice receipts and match them to shipment receipts for projects.

- *Chapter 18, "Invoice receipt detail entry,"* describes how to enter detailed information about a document, or other elements of a transaction.

- *Chapter 19, "Landed costs for receipts,"* describes how to enter, apportion, and match landed costs.

- *Chapter 20, "Taxes for receipts,"* explains how tax is calculated, modified, and distributed for receipts.

- *Chapter 21, "Receipt posting,"* describes the methods of posting transactions in Purchase Order Processing.

- *Chapter 22, "Receipt maintenance,"* includes procedures for correcting, deleting, and voiding shipment, in-transit inventory, and invoice receipts.

## Chapter 12: Receipt batches

All receipt document types can be entered in a batch. Batches are groups of transactions, identified by a name or a number, that are used for identification purposes and to make the posting process easier. You can enter receipts in batches to group similar transactions during data entry and review them before posting at a later time. Batches can be identified as a group of transactions entered by a specific employee, or a group of transactions entered on a particular date.

To post invoice receipts in a batch if you are using vendor approval workflow, the vendors assigned to invoice receipts must have the workflow status of Approved or No Approval Needed. If you post a batch and a vendor isn't approved, invoice receipts for that vendor aren't posted and remain in the batch. For more information about vendor approval workflow, see *Vendor approval workflow*.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Using batches to group receipts*

- *Creating a receipt batch*

- *Modifying or deleting a batch*

### Using batches to group receipts

Receipts can be entered individually or in batches. Individual transactions are entered and posted immediately, so your records are always up to date. You can't print edit lists for transactions that aren't entered in a batch. Batches can be used to group and save transactions, which allows you to review the transactions and make corrections before they're posted. More than one person can enter transactions in the same batch; however, a batch can't be posted if anyone is making changes to it.

Purchase Order Processing batches originate in either the Receivings Transaction

Entry window or the Purchasing Invoice Entry window. A batch with a Receivings Transaction Entry origin can contain a mix of different receipt document types. A batch with a Purchasing Invoice Entry origin can contain only invoice receipt documents. Since batches can have only one origin, you can have batches with the same name, but different origins.

- For information about entering transactions with the Receivings Transaction Entry origin, see *Chapter 13, "Shipment and in-transit inventory receipt entry."*

- For information about entering transactions with the Purchasing Invoice Entry origin, see *Chapter 16, "Invoice receipt entry."*

### Creating a receipt batch

Use the Purchasing Batch Entry window to create a receipt batch. Each transaction in the batch must have the same origin.

**To create a receipt batch:**

1. Open the Purchasing Batch Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Purchasing Batches)

    ![screenshot Purchasing Batch Entry](media/POage100.jpg)

2. Enter a batch ID to identify the batch.

3. Select a batch origin.

4. Enter a batch comment.

5. Enter a posting date.

    *This field is available only if, in the Posting Setup window, Batch is selected in the Posting Date From field.*

    The posting date you enter here is the date that General Ledger files are updated. Your records in Purchase Order Processing are updated using the receipt date you enter in the Receivings Transaction Entry window or the invoice date you enter in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window.

    If the batch contains multicurrency transactions whose exchange rates expired before the batch posting date, you will be able to save but not post those transactions.

6. When you have entered and saved all transactions for a batch, choose File \>\> Print to verify your entries with a Receivings Edit List or a Purchasing Invoice Edit List.

### Modifying or deleting a batch

Use the Purchasing Batch Entry window to change or delete an unposted batch. See *Chapter 22, "Receipt maintenance,"* for information about changing the transactions in a batch.

**To modify or delete a batch:**

1. Open the Purchasing Batch Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Purchasing Batches)

2. Enter or select a batch ID. If you enter a batch, you also must enter the batch origin before information about the batch will be displayed.

3. If you select a batch that has been marked for posting, you won't be able to edit it.

4. To correct the batch, replace the incorrect information with correct information. Choose Save to save your changes. To delete the batch, choose Delete.

## Chapter 13: Shipment and in-transit inventory receipt entry

A shipment receipt is a document used to record shipments received for purchase orders. You can enter two types of shipment receipts in Purchase Order Processing: shipment/invoice and shipment. Enter a shipment/invoice receipt to record the receipt of goods and services accompanied by an invoice. Enter a shipment receipt to record the receipt of goods and services without an invoice. You can enter receipt transactions in a batch or enter and post them individually. Receipts can't be saved unless they're in a batch.

If you are transferring material from one site to another and want to use a via site, you can enter in-transit transfers in Inventory Control. A via site is an interim location to prevent the material from being sold while the material is in-transit. After you post the in-transit transfer, you can use the Receivings Transaction Entry window to enter an in-transit inventory receipt. An in-transit inventory receipt is a document used to record the receipt of the material into the final destination site.

If you are using Project Accounting and want to enter shipment/invoice receipts or shipment receipts for projects, see *Chapter 14, "Shipment receipt entry for projects."*

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Receiving a shipment/invoice*

- *Receiving a shipment*

- *Receiving items without a purchase order*

- *Receiving items using the Select Purchase Order window*

- *Using the Select Purchase Order Items window*

- *Receiving items from multiple purchase orders*

- *Receiving items from a purchase order*

- *Entering an in-transit inventory receipt*

- *Using the Select In-Transit Items window*

- *Receiving items from in-transit transfers*

### Receiving a shipment/invoice

Use the Receivings Transaction Entry window to record a shipment/invoice if you've received an invoice and merchandise at the same time. The inventory quantity on hand will be updated for the items received and the vendor's account will be increased. You can include items from multiple purchase orders (from a single vendor) on a shipment/invoice receipt.

You can receive against line items with New, Released, Change Order, or Received statuses; however, only active items can be entered. You can continue processing if the item is inactive, but you can't change the quantity.

If you are using Workflow, the purchase order must be approved before you can receive against the purchase order. You can receive against purchase orders that don't need approval.

You can't enter a shipment/invoice receipt for a purchase order that is on hold. If a purchase order is placed on hold after its shipment/invoice receipt is saved to a batch, the receipt for that purchase order will not be posted and will remain in the batch.

If you are using Project Accounting, you can enter a shipment/invoice for blanket purchase orders. The Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Receivings Transaction Entry window, but you can't enter project information. To enter a shipment/invoice for a purchase order with project information, see *Chapter 14, "Shipment receipt entry for projects."*

You can use the View \>\> Currency menu option or the currency list button to view currency amounts in the Receivings Transaction Entry window in the originating or functional currency.

**To receive a shipment/invoice:**

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Purchasing button, and then choose the Purchase Order Transactions list.

2. In the New group or its overflow menu, choose Shipment and Invoice Receipt to open the Receivings Transaction Entry window.

    ![Screenshot of the Receivings Transaction Entry window as it appears by default.](media/POage102.jpg)

3. Enter a vendor document number.

4. Enter the receipt date.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To enter a General Ledger posting date that is different from the transaction date, choose the Date expansion button; the Receivings Date Entry window will open, where you can enter date information.

    For multicurrency transactions, the document date determines which exchange rate is used, based on the currency ID and the associated rate type entered for the transaction.

5. Enter or select a batch ID (optional).

    In multi-currency transactions, if the batch posting date does not fall on or before the exchange rate's expiration date, you will receive a message. Choose Yes to open the Batch Entry window and change the batch posting date. If you choose No, you will be able to save but not post the receipt. See *Creating a receipt batch* for more information.

6. Enter or select a vendor ID.

7. Enter or select a currency ID. If a currency ID is assigned to the vendor you select, it will appear in the Currency ID field. The currency ID assigned to the shipment/invoice must match the currency ID of the purchase orders being received against.

8. Enter or select the purchase order number for which you're receiving a shipment/invoice. You can receive items from multiple purchase orders by entering or selecting a different purchase order number in a new row. See *Receiving items from multiple purchase orders* for more information.

    If the Allow Receiving Without a Purchase Order option is marked in Purchase Order Processing Setup, you can leave the PO Number field blank.

    Before you can receive against the purchase order that has an unposted prepayment, you must post the prepayment or remove the prepayment from the purchase order.

9. Enter items using either the vendor's item number or your company's item number. You also can enter a non-inventoried item.

    You can display the vendor's item number by marking Options \>\> Display Vendor Item. If the option is not marked, your company's item number will be displayed. You can change this selection at any time.

    To add an attachment to the item, select the item and choose the Attachment Management icon to open the Document Attachment Management window.

10. Enter the quantity shipped.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Purchasing Lot Number Entry window or the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window will open if the item requires that you assign lot or serial numbers. If you are using multiple bins, you also can enter a bin number for the serial or lot number. The Bin Quantity Entry window will open if an item that isn't tracked by lot or serial numbers requires that you enter bin information.

    An icon will be displayed in the Qty Shipped field for purchase order line items with sales commitments. Select a line item and choose the button next to the Qty Shipped heading to view or prioritize commitments in the Sales Commitments for Purchase Order window. For more information, see *Committing purchase orders to sales documents*.

    If you're using multiple bins and you change the quantity shipped or the unit of measure after selecting bins for an item, you might have to modify the bin information.

11. You can change the site ID to receive line items to a location other than the location specified on the purchase order, if the option is marked in Purchase Order Processing Setup. Changing the site on the receipt will not change the site on the purchase order.

    If you are using multiple bins and you change the site ID, the default purchase receipts bin assigned to the new site ID will replace your previous bin selections. If the item is tracked by serial or lot numbers, your previous lot number or serial number selections are removed. The Purchasing Lot Number Entry window or the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window will open for you to assign lot numbers or serial numbers. You can change the bin.

12. You can edit the unit cost or extended cost, if the Allow Editing of Costs in Receiving option is marked in the Purchase Order Processing Setup window.

13. Enter the quantity invoiced, which is the number of items on the vendor's invoice.

14. Enter trade discount, freight, miscellaneous, and tax amounts.

    Taxes will be calculated automatically as you enter items. For more information about tax calculations, see *Chapter 20, "Taxes for receipts."* If you want to change the tax amounts for the document, see *Calculating and distributing summary taxes for shipment/invoice receipts*. If you want to change the tax amounts for a line item, see *Calculating and distributing detail taxes for shipment/invoice line items*.

15. The Prepayment field displays the total of all posted prepayments consumed for the purchase orders you are receiving against. The prepayment amount is recalculated if you change the quantity shipped, quantity invoiced, unit cost, or extended cost for a line item. The prepayment amount is also recalculated if you change the trade discount.

    If a purchase order has a posted prepayment, you can use the Prepayment expansion button to open the Purchasing Prepayment Summary Inquiry window. You can use this window to view the total amount of the prepayments applied and the prepayment applied amount for each purchase order assigned to the shipment/invoice.

16. Enter or accept the 1099 amount, if applicable.

17. Enter or accept the payment terms and tax schedule ID.

18. If you are using Project Accounting, choose the Amount Received expansion button to open the PA Receivings Amount Received Entry window, where you can enter an amount received. You can enter the amount you're paying by cash, check, or credit card.

19. If you are using landed costs, choose Landed Cost to open the Receivings Landed Cost Apportionment Entry window, where you can add landed costs to all line items on a receipt. See *Entering landed costs for a shipment receipt* for more information. If you want to enter landed costs for an item, see *Entering landed costs for a shipment item*.

20. Choose the Attachment Management icon to attach documents to the shipment, if applicable.

21. Choose Distributions to open the Purchasing Distribution Entry window, where you can make changes to account distributions other than the *PURCH* type distribution.

    - To add additional accounts, select the account and enter an amount.

    - To remove an account in the scrolling window, select the row containing the account and choose Edit \>\> Delete Row.

    - To restore the original distributions, choose Default.

    If you are using landed costs, the distributions for a landed cost won't be displayed in the Purchasing Distribution Entry window. To view landed cost distributions, print the Receivings Edit List.

    See *Distributing transaction amounts for shipment receipts* for more information.

22. Choose User-Defined to open the Receivings User-Defined Fields Entry window, where you can enter user-defined information for this receipt.

23. Choose Save or Post. If you post the receipt, one or more posting journals and distribution breakdown registers may be printed, depending on the options selected in the Posting Setup window.

If you've entered a batch ID, you can't post the transaction individually; you must use batch posting, series posting, or master posting. For more information, see *Chapter 12, "Receipt batches."*

#### Receiving a shipment

Use the Receivings Transaction Entry window to record a shipment if you've received merchandise but haven't received the invoice for the merchandise. A shipment transaction will increase the quantity on hand for the items received for sales and discontinued item types. You can include items from multiple purchase orders (from a single vendor) on a shipment receipt.

You can receive against line items with New, Released, Change Order, or Received statuses.

If you are using Workflow, the purchase order must be approved before you can receive against the purchase order. You can receive against purchase orders that don't need approval.

You can't enter a shipment receipt for a purchase order that is on hold. If a purchase order is placed on hold after its shipment receipt is saved to a batch, the receipt for that purchase order will not be posted and will remain in the batch.

If you are using Project Accounting, you can enter a shipment for blanket purchase orders. The Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Receivings Transaction Entry window, but you can't enter project information.

In the Receivings Transaction Entry window, continue entering receipt information, if necessary, and save or post the transaction.

### Using the Select Purchase Order Items window

Use the Select Purchase Order Items window to receive line items on multiple purchase orders. In the Select Purchase Order Items window, the tree view and the Sort By option control the information that is displayed. When you change the focus in the tree view, or when you choose a different sorting option, the information in the window is refreshed.

The scrolling window shows detail about the object selected in the tree view. When you highlight a different object in the tree view, such as a purchase order or a site, only the information about that object is displayed in the scrolling window. To display all information for a vendor, you must select the vendor ID in the tree view.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Select Purchase Order Items scrolling window.

The sorting option you select determines the order in which objects appear in the tree view and the scrolling window. You can sort objects in four ways:

- **PO/Items** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by purchase order number, then by the order items were entered on the purchase orders.

    ![Screenshot of the PO/Items object sorting window.](media/POage108.jpg)

- **Item Number/PO** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by item number, then by purchase order number under each item.

    ![Screenshot of the Item Number/PO object sorting window.](media/POage110.jpg)

- **Site/PO/Item Number** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by site, then by purchase order number under each site, then by item number under each purchase order.

    ![screenshot of the Site/PO/Item Number object sorting window.](media/POage112.jpg)

- **Site/Item Number/PO** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by site, then by item number under each site, then by purchase order number under each item.

    New, Released, or Change Order purchase orders that have one or more items with a quantity remaining to receive will be displayed. The control blanket line item for a blanket purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order isn't included when you automatically receive items.

    If only a Vendor ID is displayed, the selected vendor does not have any New, Released, or Change Order purchase orders with items to receive. Only purchase orders with currency IDs that match the receipt will be displayed. Purchase orders with posted prepayments that have currency IDs that match the receipt will be displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you know the purchase order number but not the vendor ID, you can choose AutoRcv without entering a vendor ID. The Select Purchase Order window will open. The vendor and currency ID for the receipt will come from the purchase order you select.

    ![screenshot Select Purchase Orde](media/POage116.jpg)

6. Select a sorting option.

7. Mark the check boxes next to the items you want to receive. To select all items displayed in the scrolling window, choose Mark All.

    Blanket line items with a New status or line items with a New status for a standard purchase order with an expired contract date won't be marked. To receive these items, you must mark the items individually.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you choose Mark All or Unmark All in the Select Purchase Order Items window, only items displayed in the scrolling window will be marked or unmarked. For example, if a purchase order is selected in the tree view, only items from that purchase order will be displayed in the scrolling window, and only those items will be marked when you choose Mark All. To mark or unmark all items for a vendor, the vendor ID must be selected in the tree view.

8. Select whether to display all items or only items marked to receive.

### Entering an in-transit inventory receipt

If you've entered an in-transit transfer transaction in Inventory Control, you can record the receipt of the material into the final destination site using an in-transit inventory receipt type in the Receivings Transaction Entry window. Any landed costs incurred as a result of the in-transit transfer can be recorded on the in-transit inventory receipt, as well. After you post the in-transit inventory receipt, the goods are removed from the via site and placed in the final destination site. Landed costs from in-transit transfer receipts can be invoiced just like landed costs incurred on shipments or shipment invoices in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field are displayed in the Receivings Transaction Entry window, but you can't enter project information for an in-transit inventory receipt.

**To enter an in-transit inventory receipt:**

The scrolling window shows detail about the object selected in the tree view. When you highlight a different object in the tree view, such as an in-transit item or a site, only the information about that object is displayed in the scrolling window. To display all information for an in-transit transfer, you must select the in-transit transfer in the tree view.

The sorting option you select determines the order in which objects appear in the tree view and the scrolling window. You can sort objects in four ways:

### Defining a lot number mask

Use the Item Serial/Lot Number Definition window to set up lot number masks for lot-tracked items. A lot number mask is a pre-defined lot number format used to generate lot numbers automatically. With a lot number mask, you can specify starting and ending lot numbers for an item, create incrementing segments, and control the character type. You must create a lot number mask before you can automatically generate lot numbers in Purchase Order Processing.

You also can enter a lot split quantity, which is the breakpoint for creating separate lots for a lot-tracked item. For example, assume that you enter a lot split quantity of 50. If you receive 120 units for a lot -tracked item, two lots of 50 and one lot of 20 are created. If the starting value for the mask is AA-001, the first lot is AA-001, the second lot is AA-002, and the third lot for the remainder is AA-003. If the lot split quantity is zero, the total quantity is treated as a single lot.

**To define a lot number mask:**

5. Select a character type for the first segment: Numeric, Alpha, Symbol, User Date, or Space. The character type will determine which of the remaining fields are editable.

6. Enter a size, if you selected a character type of Alpha or Numeric.

    Symbol and Space character types must have a size of 1. The size of a User Date segment depends on the date format you select.

7. Mark Increment if you want this segment to increase each time a lot number is generated. You must have at least one segment marked to increment in order to automatically generate lot numbers for an item.

    You can use the Increment option only if the character type is Alpha or Numeric. Symbol and space characters do not change. User date segments automatically increment when the user date changes.

    If more than one segment is marked to increment, the segments increment from right to left. For example, assume you have incrementing segments 0001-0001. The next lot number contains the segments 0001-0002. The first segment increments when the second reaches its maximum value (from 0001-9999 to 0002-0000). If the mask contains a date segment, other incrementing segments will reset when the date segment increments.

8. Enter starting and ending values.

    If you selected a type of User Date or Space, you won't be able to set starting and ending values. If you selected a type of Symbol, you will be able to enter a single character in the starting value field.

### Multiple bins in Purchase Order Processing

Use multiple bins to add another level of detail to item quantity tracking. Besides tracking items within inventory sites, with multiple bins you can track item quantities in bins that reside within each site. Bin quantities are processed and displayed in the item's base unit of measure.

*You can set up bin information when multiple bins functionality has been installed and registered. However, you must also enable this feature in Inventory Control before you can use bins to track items. For more information about enabling multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation.*

Default bins for transaction types at each site can be identified for use in transactions. For example, a default bin could be created for purchasing transactions at your warehouse site. Default bins can also be identified for a particular item and transaction type at a site. If you always use Bin A when purchasing a certain item from your main site, for example, you can set up Bin A as the default purchase receipts bin for the item at the main site. Microsoft Dynamics GP automatically creates item-site-bin relationships the first time a bin is used for a transaction.

When you enter a transaction, the default bin for the transaction type at the itemsite or the site is used automatically. If there isn't a default bin at the item-site or at the site, you will be required to enter a bin. If the site's default bin is used, an itemsite-bin record is created automatically. If you delete the line or document after the item-site-bin record is automatically created, that item-site-bin record is not deleted. The on-hand quantity of the item increases at the bin within the site when you post a shipment or shipment/invoice.

For more information about setting up and using multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation.

### Changing bins for a receipt

If you're using multiple bins, use the Bin Quantity Entry window to verify or change bin allocations for items that are not tracked by serial or lot numbers.

For items that are tracked by serial or lot numbers, you can verify or change bins in the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window or the Purchasing Lot Number Entry window for shipment receipts and shipment/invoice receipts. You can use the InTransit Serial Number Entry window or the In-Transit Lot Number Entry window to verify or change bins for items that tracked serials or lot numbers for in-transit inventory receipt.

You can distribute a line item quantity to multiple bins. For example, if the quantity shipped is 20, you can receive 15 items into Bin 1, and five into Bin 2 at site A. You might need to change bin selections manually if you change quantities, the unit of measure, or the site after you already selected bins.

**To change bins for a receipt item that isn't tracked by serial or lot numbers:**

1. Open the Receivings Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Receivings Transaction Entry)

2. Enter or select a shipment receipt, a shipment/invoice receipt, or an in-transit inventory receipt.

3. Select an item that isn't tracked by serial or lot numbers and choose the Qty Shipped expansion button to open the Bin Quantity Entry window.

### Merging trade discount and purchase distributions

If you've marked the Merge Trade Discount Distributions in Purchasing option in the Company Setup Options window, the trade discount distributions will be merged with the purchases distribution for shipment/invoice receipts. If you are using Project Accounting, the trade discount distributions won't be merged with the purchases distributions for shipment/invoice receipts.

For example, assume that you've entered a purchase transaction of \$100.00 with a trade discount of \$15.00. If you've marked the Merge Trade Discount Distributions in Purchasing option, the trade discount distributions will be merged as in the following example.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A PURCH | \$85      |            |
| Account C PAY   |           | \$85       |

If you didn't mark the Merge Trade Discount Distributions in Purchasing option, the trade discount distributions are separated from the purchase distribution.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A PURCH | \$100     |            |
| Account B TRADE |           | \$15       |
| Account C PAY   |           | \$85       |

### Distributing transaction amounts for shipment receipts

Use the Purchasing Distribution Entry window to redistribute transaction amounts to posting accounts. Transactions will be distributed automatically to the posting accounts assigned in the Vendor Account Maintenance window or the Item Account Maintenance window. If accounts aren't assigned to vendor or item records, the accounts assigned in the Posting Accounts Setup window will be used instead.

If you are using landed costs, the distributions are calculated for a landed cost but won't be displayed in the Purchasing Distribution Entry window. To view landed cost distributions, print the Receivings Edit List.

Currency amounts in the Purchasing Distribution Entry window are displayed in both the functional and originating currencies.

**To distribute transaction amounts for shipment receipts:**

1. Open the Receivings Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Receivings Transaction Entry)

2. Enter or select a shipment or shipment/invoice.

3. Choose Distributions to open the Purchasing Distribution Entry window.

    ![screenshot Purchasing Distribution Entry](media/POage153.jpg)

5. Change the amounts for the default accounts. To distribute the transaction to multiple posting accounts, change the default amount in the scrolling window.

6. In the next available line, enter or select another purchasing distribution account, choose the distribution type and enter the next amount.

    If you want to remove a distribution, select it and choose Edit \>\> Delete Row. If you changed distribution accounts and amounts and decide you want to use the original distributions, choose Default.

7. Continue entering distribution accounts until your transaction is fully distributed.

8. Enter a distribution reference (optional).

    This is the reference that will post as the General Ledger distribution reference for the account. If you leave this field blank, the reference information entered in the Reference field will post to General Ledger.

9. Choose OK to save your entries. Continue entering the transaction. You can save the transaction if it's not fully distributed, but you won't be able to post until the full amount is distributed and debits equal credits.

### Entering Intrastat trade statistics

Use the Purchasing Intrastat Entry window to enter the information required to create the Intrastat Trade Report you submit to your government. You can enter Intrastat statistics for each line item. For information about setting up Intrastat codes, refer to your System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting Up the System).

Intrastat is the system for collecting statistics on the trade of goods between European Union (EU) countries/regions. Intrastat data is required for all items either bought from EU vendors or sold to EU customers, and must be provided on a monthly basis. Requirements for Intrastat are similar in all EU countries/regions. The government uses these statistics as an economic indicator.

If Intrastat information was entered for the vendor's ship from address ID, that information appears in this window. Each time you enter a new line item, the Intrastat statistics from the previous line item will be the default Intrastat entry for the new line item. You can use the Purchasing Intrastat Entry window to change Intrastat information for an individual transaction, or to enter Intrastat information if none was entered for the vendor.

*You can enter Intrastat statistics only if you have marked to enable Intrastat tracking in the Company Setup Options window.*

**To enter Intrastat trade statistics:**

1. Open the Receivings Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Receivings Transaction Entry)

2. Enter the shipment/invoice receipt and mark the EU transaction option.

3. Choose the EU button to open the Purchasing Intrastat Entry window. You can also open the Purchasing Intrastat Entry window by choosing the EU button in the Receivings Item Detail Entry window.

8. In the Traders Reference field, enter a reference code, such as an invoice or dispatch number, or any other information that will identify the transaction.

9. Enter a goods value and statistical value, if applicable.

10. Choose OK to save the record.

## Chapter 16: Invoice receipt entry

Enter an invoice receipt to record an invoice received for a shipment receipt entered and posted earlier, or to record an invoice received for a shipment that you have not yet received. You also can enter an invoice for drop-ship purchase order line items and blanket drop-ship purchase order line items. You can enter invoice receipt transactions in a batch or enter and post them individually. Invoice receipts can't be saved unless they're in a batch.

*If you are using vendor approval workflow, the vendor must have the workflow status of Approved or No Approval Needed before you can post the invoice receipt.*

If you are using Project Accounting, see *Chapter 17, "Invoice receipt entry for projects"* to enter invoice receipts for projects.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Entering an invoice receipt*

- *Matching shipments to an invoice receipt*

- *Invoicing items without a purchase order*

- *Invoicing items using the Select Purchase Order window*

- *Using the Select Purchase Order Items window*

- *Invoicing items from multiple purchase orders*

- *Invoicing items from a purchase order*

### Entering an invoice receipt

Use the Purchasing Invoice Entry window to enter, save, and post invoice receipts. You can enter detailed information for each invoice. You can include items from multiple purchase orders (from a single vendor) on an invoice receipt. If you are using landed costs, you can enter a landed cost as a line item.

If you are using Workflow, a drop-ship purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order must be approved before you can invoice against the purchase order. You can invoice against purchase orders that don't need approval.

You can enter and save, but not post, invoice receipts for purchase orders that are on hold. If an invoice for an on hold purchase order is saved to a batch, the batch can be posted, but the invoice for the on hold purchase order will remain in the batch.

If you expect to receive multiple invoices for a single shipment, we recommend that you post the shipment receipt and invoice receipts separately instead of entering a shipment/invoice receipt document. If you enter a single shipment/invoice receipt document (with Quantity Shipped greater than Quantity Invoiced) in the Receivings Transaction Entry window and later enter additional invoice documents, amounts in General Ledger and Inventory won't match.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window, but you can't enter project information for blanket purchase orders. To enter an invoice for a purchase order with project information, see *Chapter 17, "Invoice receipt entry for projects."*

You can use the View \>\> Currency menu option or the currency list button to view amounts in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window in originating or functional currency.

**To enter an invoice receipt:**

1. In the navigation pane, choose the Purchasing button, and then choose the Purchase Order Transactions list.

2. In the New group or its overflow menu, choose Invoice Receipt to open the Purchasing Invoice Entry window.

    ![screenshot Purchasing Invoice Entry](media/POage158.jpg)

3. Enter a vendor document number.

4. Enter the invoice date.

    > [!TIP]
    > To enter a General Ledger posting date that is different from the invoice date, choose the Invoice Date expansion button; the Purchasing Invoice Date Entry window will open, where you can enter date information.

    For multicurrency transactions, the document date determines which exchange rate is used, based on the currency ID that's entered for the transaction and the associated rate type.

5. Enter or select a batch ID (optional).

    If you've received the invoice, but not the shipment, you'll need to save the invoice receipt in a batch until you receive and post the shipment. Then you can match the invoice to the shipment and post the invoice.

    Invoices entered for drop-ship purchase orders and drop-ship blanket purchase orders won't be matched because you can't enter a shipment receipt for a dropship purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order.

    In multicurrency transactions, if the batch posting date does not fall on or before the exchange rate's expiration date, you will receive a message. Choose Yes to open the Batch Entry window and change the batch posting date. If you choose No, you will be able to save but not post the receipt.

    See *Creating a receipt batch* for more information.

6. Enter or select a vendor ID.

7. Enter or select a currency ID, or change the currency ID that appears as a default entry.

    If the currency ID is not the company's functional currency, a rate type and associated exchange rate table are assigned to the transaction. The currency ID assigned to the invoice must match the currency ID of the purchase order being received against.

8. Mark the LC option if you want to enter a landed cost.

9. Enter the purchase order number.

    You can leave this field blank if you're entering an invoice for a shipment received without a purchase order. You can receive invoices for multiple purchase orders by entering or selecting a different purchase order number in a new row.

    You won't be able to enter a purchase order number if you are invoicing a landed cost. You will specify the purchase order you are matching to the landed cost in the Match Options window.

    Before you can invoice against the purchase order that has an unposted prepayment, you must post the prepayment or remove the prepayment from the purchase order.

10. Enter items using either the vendor's item number or your company's item number. If you marked the LC option, you can enter a landed cost as an item.

    After you enter a drop-ship or drop-ship blanket line item, the drop-ship purchase order icon appears in the PO Number field.

    You can display the vendor's item number by marking Options \>\> Display Vendor Item. If the option is not marked, your company's item number will be displayed. You can change this selection at any time.

11. If a drop-ship or drop-ship blanket line item is tracking serial or lot numbers, mark the S/L option.

12. Enter the quantity invoiced, which is the number of items on the vendor's invoice.

    If multiple shipments exist for the line item, you'll get a message asking if you want to match the invoice line items to items on a shipment or shipment/ invoice before you move to the next line item.

    - Choose Yes and the Match Shipments to Invoice window will open, where you can choose which line items can be matched.

    - Choose No and the line items automatically will be matched in shipment receipt number order.

    For more information, see *Matching shipments to an invoice receipt*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Purchasing Lot Number Entry window or the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window will open if the drop-ship or drop-ship blanket line item requires that you assign lot or serial numbers.

    An icon will be displayed in the Quantity Invoiced field for drop-ship purchase order line items with sales commitments. Select a line item and choose the button next to the Quantity Invoiced heading to view commitments in the Sales Commitments for Purchase Order window. If the purchase order line item is committed to more than one sales order line item, you can use the Sales Commitments for Purchase Order window to specify the sequence in which the sales line items will be received. For more information, see *Committing purchase orders to sales documents*.

13. Enter trade discount, freight, miscellaneous, and tax amounts.

    Taxes will be calculated automatically as you enter items. For more information about tax calculations, see *Chapter 20, "Taxes for receipts."* If you want to change the tax amounts for the document, see *Calculating and distributing summary taxes for invoice receipts*. If you want to change the tax amounts for a line item, see *Calculating and distributing detail taxes for invoice line items*.

14. The Prepayment field displays the total of all posted prepayments consumed for the purchase orders you are invoicing against. The prepayment amount is recalculated if you change the quantity shipped, quantity invoiced, unit cost, or extended cost for a line item. The prepayment amount is also recalculated if you change the trade discount.

    If a purchase order has a posted prepayment, you can use the Prepayment expansion button to open the Purchasing Prepayment Summary Inquiry window. You can use this window to view the total amount of the prepayments applied and the prepayment applied amount for each purchase order assigned to the invoice.

15. Enter or accept the 1099 amount, if applicable.

16. If you are using Project Accounting, choose the Amount Received expansion button to open the PA Purchasing Invoice Amount Received Entry window, where you can enter an amount received. You can enter the amount you're paying by cash, check, or credit card.

17. Choose Distributions to open the Purchasing Invoice Distribution Entry window, where you can make changes to account distributions. See *Distributing transaction amounts for invoice receipts* for more information.

18. Choose Save or Post. If you post, the invoiced quantities for each item on the receipt must be fully matched to shipment quantities.

One or more posting journals and distribution breakdown registers may be printed, depending on the options selected in the Posting Setup window. If you saved the transaction to a batch, you can print an edit list.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you receive the error message *Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'UseQtyOverageTolerance'*  when you post an invoice receipt, review the [blog post](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp/posts/are-you-unable-to-invoice-a-purchase-order-because-of-the-following-error-cannot-insert-the-value-null-into-column-useqtyoveragetolerance-table-460621404) for suggested troubleshooting.


### Matching shipments to an invoice receipt

Use the Match Shipments to Invoice window if you've entered shipments in the Receivings Transaction Entry window and want to match the line items on the shipments to an invoice you're entering in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window. Invoices entered for drop-ship purchase orders or drop-ship blanket purchase orders won't be matched because you can't enter a shipment receipt for a drop-ship purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order. For information about matching shipment line items to landed costs, see *Matching landed costs to shipment line items*. Landed costs aren't automatically matched.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Match Shipments to Invoice window. To match shipments to an invoice receipt with project information, see *Chapter 17, "Invoice receipt entry for projects."*

### Use the Select Purchase Order Items window

Use the Select Purchase Order Items window to invoice line items that have been received from multiple purchase orders. In the Select Purchase Order Items window, the tree view and the Sort By option control the information that is displayed. When you change the focus in the tree view, or when you choose a different sorting option, the information in the window is refreshed.

The scrolling window shows detail about the object selected in the tree view. When you highlight a different object in the tree view, such as a purchase order or a site, only the information about that object is displayed in the scrolling window. To display all information for a vendor, you must select the vendor ID in the tree view.

If you are using Project Accounting, the Project Number field and the Cost Category ID field will be displayed in the Select Purchase Order Items scrolling window.

The sorting option you select determines the order in which objects appear in the tree view and the scrolling window. You can sort objects in four ways:

**PO/Items** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by purchase order number, then by the order items were entered on the purchase orders.

![Screenshot of the PO/Items sorting option window.](media/POage164.jpg)

**Item Number/PO** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by item number, then by purchase order number under each item.

![Screenshot of the Item Number/PO sorting option window.](media/POage166.jpg)

**Site/PO/Item Number** Objects in the tree view and scrolling window are sorted first by site, then by purchase order number under each site, then by item number under each purchase order.

![Screenshot of the Site/PO/Item Number sorting option window.](media/POage168.jpg)

## Chapter 17: Invoice receipt entry for projects

If you are using Project Accounting, you can enter an invoice receipt to record an invoice received for a shipment receipt entered and posted earlier, or to record an invoice received for a shipment that you have not yet received. You also can enter an invoice for drop-ship purchase order line items. You can enter invoice receipt transactions in a batch and save them to post later, or enter and post them individually.

*If you are using vendor approval workflow, the vendor must have the workflow status of Approved or No Approval Needed before you can post the invoice receipts.*

To enter an invoice receipt for a blanket purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order, refer to *Chapter 16, "Invoice receipt entry."*

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Entering an invoice receipt for projects*

- *Matching shipments to an invoice receipt for projects*

- *Invoicing items for projects without a purchase order*

- *Invoicing items for projects using the Select Purchase Order window*

- *Invoicing items for projects from multiple purchase orders*

- *Invoicing items for projects from a purchase order*

### Entering an invoice receipt for projects

Use the Purchasing Invoice Entry window to enter, save, and post invoice receipts for projects. You can enter detailed information for each invoice. You can include items from multiple purchase orders (from a single vendor) on an invoice receipt. If you are using landed costs, you can enter a landed cost as a line item.

To enter an invoice receipt for a blanket purchase order, refer to *Chapter 16, "Invoice receipt entry."*

You can enter and save, but not post, invoice receipts for purchase orders that are on hold. If an invoice for a purchase order that is on hold is saved to a batch, the batch can be posted, but the invoice for the purchase order that is on hold will remain in the batch.

If you expect to receive multiple invoices for a single shipment, we recommend that you post the shipment receipt and invoice receipts separately instead of entering a shipment/invoice receipt document. If you enter a single shipment/invoice receipt document (with quantity shipped greater than quantity invoiced) in the Receivings Transaction Entry window and later enter additional invoice documents, amounts in General Ledger and Inventory won't match.

You can use the View \>\> Currency menu option or the currency list button to view amounts in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window in originating or functional currency.

**To enter an invoice receipt for projects:**

1. Open the Purchasing Invoice Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Enter/Match Invoices)

2. Enter or select the receipt number.

3. Enter a vendor document number.

4. Enter the invoice date.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To enter a General Ledger posting date that is different from the invoice date, choose the Invoice Date expansion button; the Purchasing Invoice Date Entry window will open, where you can enter date information.

    For multicurrency transactions, the document date determines which exchange rate is used, based on the currency ID that's entered for the transaction and the associated rate type.

5. Enter or select a batch ID (optional).

    If you've received the invoice, but not the shipment, you'll need to save the invoice receipt in a batch until you receive and post the shipment. Then you can match the invoice to the shipment and post the invoice.

    Invoices entered for drop-ship purchase orders won't be matched because you can't enter a shipment receipt for a drop-ship purchase order.

    In multicurrency transactions, if the batch posting date does not fall on or before the exchange rate's expiration date, you will receive a message. Choose Yes to open the Batch Entry window and change the batch posting date. If you choose No, you will be able to save but not post the receipt.

    See *Creating a receipt batch* for more information.

6. Enter or select a vendor ID.

7. Enter or select a currency ID, or change the currency ID that appears as a default entry.

    If the currency ID is not the company's functional currency, a rate type and associated exchange rate table are assigned to the transaction. The currency ID assigned to the invoice must match the currency ID of the purchase order being received against.

8. Mark the LC option if you want to enter a landed cost.

9. Enter the purchase order number.

    You can leave this field blank if you're entering an invoice for a shipment received without a purchase order. You can receive invoices for multiple purchase orders by entering or selecting a different purchase order number in a new row.

    You can't enter a purchase order number if you are invoicing a landed cost. You will specify the purchase order you are matching the to the landed cost in the Match Options window.

    You can enter a purchase order that hasn't been printed if Allow Receiving of Unprinted PO option is marked in the PA Purchase Order Processing Setup Options window.

10. Enter a project number and cost category ID.

    You can't enter a project number or a cost category if the Options \>\> Display Vendor Item is marked to display the vendor items.

11. Enter one or more items using your company's item numbers. You also can enter non-inventoried items. If you marked the LC option, you can enter a landed cost as an item.

    Inventoried items entered for a project must be assigned to a cost category in the Budget Detail IV Items window. If the item isn't assigned to a budget, you must add the item to the budget.

    After you enter a drop-ship line item, the drop-ship purchase order icon appears in the PO Number field.

12. If a drop-ship line item is tracking serial or lot numbers, mark the S/L option.

13. Enter the quantity invoiced, which is the number of items on the vendor's invoice.

    If multiple shipments exist for the line item, you'll get a message asking if you want to match the invoice line items to items on a shipment or shipment/ invoice before you move to the next line item.

    - Choose Yes and the Match Shipments to Invoice window will open, where you can choose which line items can be matched.

    - Choose No and the line items automatically will be matched in shipment receipt number order.

    For more information, see *Matching shipments to an invoice receipt for projects*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Purchasing Lot Number Entry window or the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window will open if the drop-ship line item requires that you assign lot or serial numbers.

14. Enter trade discount, freight, miscellaneous, and tax amounts.

    Taxes will be calculated automatically as you enter items. For more information about tax calculations, see *Chapter 20, "Taxes for receipts."* You can't change the Tax amount in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window even if your system is set up to allow editing summary-level taxes. If you want to change the tax amounts for a line item, see *Calculating and distributing detail taxes for invoice line items*.

15. Enter or accept the 1099 amount, if applicable.

16. To enter an amount received, choose the Amount Received expansion button to open the PA Receivings Amount Received Entry window. You can enter the amount you're paying by cash, check, or credit card.

17. Choose Distributions to open the Purchasing Invoice Distribution Entry window, where you can make changes to account distributions. See *Distributing transaction amounts for invoice receipts* for more information.

18. Choose Save or Post. If you post, the invoiced quantities for each item on the receipt must be fully matched to shipment quantities.

One or more posting journals and distribution breakdown registers may be printed, depending on the options selected in the Posting Setup window. If you saved the transaction to a batch, you can print an edit list.

### Matching shipments to an invoice receipt for projects

Use the Match Shipments to Invoice window if you've entered shipments in the Receivings Transaction Entry window and want to match the line items on the shipments to an invoice you're entering in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window. Invoices entered for drop-ship purchase orders won't be matched because you can't enter a shipment receipt for a drop-ship purchase order. For information about matching shipment line items to landed costs, see *Matching landed costs to shipment line items*. Landed costs aren't automatically matched.

If you want match shipments for blanket purchase orders to an invoice receipt, see *Chapter 16, "Invoice receipt entry."*

## Chapter 19: Landed costs for receipts

Landed costs are the additional costs that might be associated with purchasing a product. For example, if you purchase items from another country/region, the amount you must pay also might include freight costs, or duties.

To assign a landed cost to all the items on a receipt, use the Receivings Landed Cost Apportionment window. To assign a landed cost to an item on a receipt, use the Receivings Landed Cost Entry window.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Landed cost overview*

- *How landed costs are apportioned*

- *Invoice matching and distributions*

- *Entering landed costs for a shipment receipt*

- *Entering landed costs for an in-transit inventory receipt*

- *Entering landed costs for a shipment item*

- *Entering landed costs for an in-transit inventory item*

- *Matching landed costs to shipment line items*

- *Matching landed costs to in-transit inventory line items*

### Landed cost overview

Landed costs are the additional costs that might be associated with purchasing a product, such as freight costs, insurance, or duties. To use landed costs, you must set up landed cost records and groups in Inventory Control. You can define different landed costs in the Landed Cost Maintenance window, including information such as the vendor the landed cost is for, the cost calculation method used, and whether invoices must be matched. You can create as many landed cost records as you like.

Once you've created landed cost records, you can create landed cost groups using the Landed Cost Group Maintenance window. A landed cost group is a collection of several landed cost records. Each landed cost record can exist in multiple landed cost groups. Each landed cost group can include as many landed cost records as you like. By creating a landed cost group and assigning it to item-site combinations, you can associate many different landed cost records with an item-site combination. For more information about landed cost records and groups, refer to the Inventory Control documentation.

When the item-site combination is entered on a purchase order or in-transit transfer, the landed cost group information automatically is reflected in the transaction. You can enter a landed cost group or accept the default landed cost group ID for the purchase order or in-transit transfer. You can use the Item Quantities Maintenance window to enter information for each item-site combination.

As you enter a receipt in Purchase Order Processing, you can assign landed costs. To assign a landed cost to all the items on a receipt, use the Receivings Landed Cost Apportionment window. To assign a landed cost to an item on a receipt, use the Receivings Landed Cost Entry window.

You can use the Match Shipments to Invoice window to match the landed costs that you've entered in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window to one or more shipment items or in-transit inventory items. Landed costs aren't automatically matched. To match the landed costs to shipment items or in-transit inventory items, the landed costs must be set up to invoice match. You can mark the landed costs to match when entering landed costs using the Receivings Landed Cost Apportionment window or the Receivings Landed Cost Entry window. More information about landed costs is included in the Inventory Control documentation.

### How landed costs are apportioned

In the Receivings Landed Cost Apportionment window, you can select how to apportion or distribute the landed cost amounts among line items.You can apportion a calculation method of Flat Amount by Value, Quantity, or Weight. If the calculation method is Flat Amount per Unit or Percent of Extended Cost, the landed costs will be created for all line items.

During the apportionment calculation, a remaining amount for the flat amount is tracked. The calculated apportionment amount for each line item is subtracted from the remaining amount. If a remaining amount can't be distributed across items due to rounding, it will be distributed to the last line item.

#### Quantity apportionment calculation

If you selected to apportion landed costs by quantity, the calculation for apportionment is a line item's quantity shipped - the quantity rejected / the sum of all line items' quantity shipped - quantity rejected x the Flat Amount.

For example, assume that you have the following receipt line items entered. The calculation amount for the landed cost is Flat Amount and the Flat Amount is \$50.00.

| **Item** | **Qty shipped** | **Qty rejected** | **Unit cost** | **Extended cost** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Item1    | 10              | 2                | 10.00         | 80.00             |
| Item2    | 2               | 0                | 20.00         | 40.00             |
| Item3    | 6.5467          | 0.000            | 2             | 13.09             |

The landed cost would be apportioned as follows:

| **Item**  | **Qty shipped** | **Qty rejected** | **Net qty shipped** | **Landed cost calculation**   | **Remaining amt**    | **Landed cost amt** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Item1     | 10              | 2                | 8                   | (8/16.5467) x 50 = 24.17      | 50.00 - 24.17 =26.83 | 24.17               |
| Item2     | 2               | 0                | 2                   | (2/16.5467) x 50 = 6.04       | 26.83 - 6.04 = 19.79 | 6.04                |
| Item3     | 6.5467          | 0.000            | 6.5467              | (6.5467/16.5467) x 50 = 19.78 | 19.79 - 19.78 =.01   | 19.79               |
| **Total** | 18.5467         | 2                | 16.5467             |                               | 50.00                | 50.00               |

> [!NOTE]
> The last item receives the remaining \$.01.

#### Value apportionment calculation

If you selected to apportion landed costs by Value, the calculation for apportionment is the percent of the line item's value to the total of all the line items' value x the Flat Amount.

The percent is calculated as [(Individual Line Item's Qty Shipped - Individual Line Item's Qty Rejected) x Originating Unit Cost]/ Sum of all line item's [Qty Shipped- Qty Rejected) x Originating Unit Cost)].

For example, assume that you have the following receipt line items entered. The calculation amount for the landed cost is Flat Amount and the Flat Amount is \$50.00.

| **Item** | **Qty shipped** | **Qty rejected** | **Unit cost** | **Extended cost** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Item1    | 10              | 2                | 10.00         | 80.00             |
| Item2    | 5               | 0                | 20.00         | 100.00            |
| Item3    | 6.5467          | 0.000            | 2             | 13.09             |

The landed cost would be apportioned as follows

| **Item**  | **Landed cost calculation**                                                                       | **Remaining amt**     | **Landed cost amt** |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Item1     | [[(10-2) x 10.00)]/[(10-2) x 10.00]+ [(5-0) x 20.00]+[(6.5467-0.0000) x 2.00]]x 50.00 = 20.72     | 50.00 - 20.72 = 29.28 | 20.72               |
| Item2     | [[(5-0) x 20.00)]/[(10-2) x 10.00]+ [(5-0) x 20.00]+[(6.5467-0.0000) x 2.00]] x 50.00 = 25.89     | 29.28 - 25.89 = 3.39  | 25.89               |
| Item3     | [[(6.5467-0) x 2.00)]/[(10-2) x 10.00]+ [(5-0) x 20.00]+[(6.5467- 0.0000) x 2.00]] x 50.00 = 3.39 | 3.39 - 3.39 = 0.00    | 3.39                |
| **Total** |                                                                                                   | 50.00                 | 50.00               |

#### Weight apportionment calculation

If you selected to apportion landed costs by Weight, the calculation for apportionment is the (Individual Line Item's Extended Shipping Weight / Sum of all line items' Extended Shipping Weight} x the Flat Amount.

The Extended Shipping Weight is calculated as the Individual Line Item's Shipping Weight x (quantity shipped - quantity rejected).

For example, assume that you have the following receipt line items entered. The calculation amount for the landed cost is Flat Amount and the Flat Amount is \$50.00.

| **Item**  | **Shipping weight** | **Qty shipped** | **Qty rejected** | **Extended shipping weight**      | **Unit cost** | **Extended cost** |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Item1     | 5.00                | 10              | 2                | 5.00 x (10 - 2) = 40              | 10.00         | 80.00             |
| Item2     | 1.23                | 5               | 0                | 1.23 x (5 - 0) = 6.15             | 20.00         | 100.00            |
| Item3     | .99                 | 6.5467          | 0.0000           | 0.99 x (6.5467 - 0.0000) = 6.4812 | 2.00          | 13.09             |
| **Total** |                     |                 |                  | 52.6312                           |               |                   |

The landed cost would be apportioned as follows

| **Item**  | **Shipping weight** | **Landed cost calculation**     | **Remaining amt**     | **Landed cost amt** |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Item1     | 5.00                | (40.00/52.6312) x 50.00 = 38.00 | 50.00 - 38.00 = 12.00 | 38.00               |
| Item2     | 1.23                | (6.15/52.6312) x 50.00 = 5.84   | 12.00 - 5.84 = 6.16   | 5.84                |

### Invoice matching and distributions

Matching items assigned to a shipment or shipment/invoice to the landed costs entered on the invoice will affect account distributions. If you decide not to match, you will be responsible for making entries of the accrual account into an adjusting expense account for cost variances. For example, suppose that a shipment is recorded for 10 items at \$1 each. The landed cost uses the Flat Amount cost calculation method on an amount of \$0.50.

The distributions for the shipment would look as follows:

| **Account**                     | **Debit amount** | **Credit amount** |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Inventory                       | \$10.50          |                   |
| Accrued Purchases - Landed Cost |                  | \$0.50            |
| Accrued Purchases - Inventory   |                  | \$10              |

Suppose that when the invoice is received, the cost of the goods is
unchanged, but the landed cost has increased to \$0.75. If Match is not
marked, the account distributions would be as follows:

| **Account**                     | **Debit amount** | **Credit amount** |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Accrued Purchases - Landed Cost | \$0.75           |                   |
| Accrued Purchases - Inventory   | \$10             |                   |
| Accounts Payable                |                  | \$10.75           |

If Match and Revalue IV is marked, the account distributions would be as
follows:

| **Account**                     | **Debit amount** | **Credit amount** |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Accrued Purchases - Landed Cost | \$0.50           |                   |
| Accrued Purchases - Inventory   | \$10             |                   |
| Inventory                       | \$0.25           |                   |
| Accounts Payable                |                  | \$10.75           |

### Calculating and distributing summary taxes for invoice receipts

Use the Purchasing Invoice Tax Summary Entry window to add, change, delete, or view summarized tax amounts for an invoice, as well as the accounts to which the amounts will be posted. Taxes are calculated automatically as you enter each tax detail or edit the Total Purchases amount. Summary tax edits won't change the taxes calculated for each line item in the Purchasing Invoice Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

If your system isn't set up to allow editing summary-level taxes, you can't change the Tax amount in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window or the tax information in the Purchasing Invoice Tax Summary Entry window, except for the account. You'll be able to change the account for tax included in item taxes at the summary level regardless of how your system is set up. If you want to change tax information, use the Purchasing Invoice Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

## Chapter 21: Receipt posting

Posting is the process of transferring transactions to permanent records. Until transactions are posted, they can be changed or deleted. After you post transactions in Purchase Order Processing, they can't be changed or deleted. To print a posting journal after the transaction was posted, use the Purchasing Posting Journals window or the Purchasing Posting Journal Options window.

Posting reports will be printed when you post transactions, either individually or in batches. For more information about posting reports for Purchase Order Processing, refer to *Purchase Order Processing standard reports summary*.

*For more information about setting up posting, see the System Setup Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).*

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Posting a receipt*

- *Posting a purchasing batch*

- *Posting Purchasing series batches*

### Posting a receipt

Transaction-level posting allows you to enter and post transactions individually without ever having to create a batch. Purchasing receipt information always will be up-to-date immediately when you post using this method, because transactions must be posted or deleted immediately. They can't be saved or posted later.

You can perform transaction-level posting in the Receivings Transaction Entry window and in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window. Purchasing and inventory information will be update immediately every time you post using this method. All transactions posted individually in a single data entry session will have the same audit trail code.

Transaction-level posting is optional and can be selected in the Posting Setup window when you set up Microsoft Dynamics GP. If you aren't allowed to post individual transactions, you'll be asked to create a batch when you attempt to post transactions. Also, you can post an individual transaction that was previously entered in a batch. To do so, select the transaction from the batch, clear the Batch ID field and post the transaction.

If you're posting by transaction date, the posting date and the document date will be the same. If you change the posting date in the date entry window, the document date won't be affected.

You can't post to a year that hasn't been set up using the Fiscal Periods Setup window. Also, if the year has been set up but the Purchasing period is closed, posting won't be allowed. The posting journal will indicate the transactions that were posted, as well as the transactions that weren't posted. Transactions will be posted to General Ledger, even if a Financial series period has been closed. However, transactions will not post through General Ledger.

The reports for individually posted transactions contain information only for the transactions that were entered and posted since the Receivings Transaction Entry window or the Purchasing Invoice Entry window was opened. These reports are printed when you close the window.

### Posting a purchasing batch

Use the Purchasing Batch Entry window to post a single batch. Before you post, be sure quantities for each item on an invoice receipt are fully matched to shipment quantities.

**To post a purchasing batch:**

1. Make a backup of your company's data. Refer your System Administrator's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select System Administration) for more information about making backups.

2. Open the Purchasing Batch Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Purchasing Batches)

3. Print an edit list to review the transactions in the batch. An edit list can be printed from the Purchasing Batch Entry window by choosing File \>\> Print with the appropriate batch ID displayed. If you need to make corrections, do so at this time.

4. Enter or select the batch ID and origin for the batch you want to post.

5. Choose Post. Your Purchase Order Processing records will be updated to reflect the information from the transactions. Your General Ledger accounts will be updated depending on your posting setup selections.

    If you're set up to post to General Ledger in the Posting Setup window, the batch appears in the Financial Series Posting and Master Posting windows; you can edit the transactions in the General Ledger Transaction Entry window before posting them again. Your accounts are updated when you post the transactions in General Ledger.

    If you post through General Ledger, your accounts are updated at once and you don't need to post the batch again in General Ledger.

6. One or more posting journals may be printed, depending on the options selected in the Posting Setup window. A Report Destination window may appear for each posting journal that was selected to print, depending on how they were set up.

### Posting Purchasing series batches

Use the Purchasing Series Posting window to post multiple batches in the Purchasing series at the same time. Before you post, be sure quantities for each item on an invoice receipt are fully matched to shipment quantities.

**To post Purchasing series batches:**

1. Make a backup of your company's data. Refer your System Administrator's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select System Administration) for more information about making backups.

2. Print an edit list to review the transactions in the batch. An edit list can be printed from the Purchasing Batch Entry window by choosing File \>\> Print with the appropriate batch ID displayed. If you need to make corrections, do so at this time.

3. Open the Purchasing Series Posting window. (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Series Post)

    ![screenshot Purchasing Series Posting](media/POage199.jpg)

4. Mark the box next to the batch ID for each batch you want to post. The status changes to Marked, which indicates to other users that the batch is ready to be posted.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a batch was marked previously, the User ID column identifies the person who marked it. If you want to post that batch, unmark it and mark it again so the batch is assigned to you. Series posting allows you to post only those batches that you've marked; you can't post batches marked by another user.

5. Choose Post. One or more posting journals may be printed, depending on the options selected in the Posting Setup window. A Report Destination window may appear for each posting journal that was selected to print, depending on how they were set up.

## Chapter 22: Receipt maintenance

Proper maintenance of your receiving information is essential for preserving the accuracy of your records. This chapter focuses on the tasks that allow you to maintain your records effectively.

Throughout the receiving process, you can print a variety of reports you can use to double-check documents you've entered. If you identify errors on these reports, the errors must be corrected to ensure accurate reporting of your receiving activity. You also may want to delete or void shipment, shipment/invoice and invoice receipts that are no longer valid.

If you are using Purchase Order Enhancements, you can process returns against Purchase Order Processing receipts. Items that have been received on a shipment or shipment/invoice receipt can be returned as a Return or a Return w/Credit document type. For more information, see the Purchase Order Enhancements documentation.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Correcting unposted shipment, shipment/invoice, and in-transit inventory receipts*

- *Correcting unposted invoice receipts*

- *About deleting and voiding receipts*

- *Deleting shipment, shipment/invoice, or in-transit inventory receipts*

- *Voiding shipment, shipment/invoice, or in-transit inventory receipts*

- *Deleting invoice receipts*

- *Voiding invoice receipts*

### Correcting unposted shipment, shipment/invoice, and in-transit inventory receipts

Use the Receivings Transaction Entry window to correct shipment, shipment/invoice, or in-transit inventory receipts before posting. After you enter receipts, print an edit list to determine if the entries contain errors. (You can print edit lists only for receipts entered in a batch.) If you discover that an unposted receipt was entered incorrectly, you can correct the error using the following procedure.

**To correct unposted shipment, shipment/invoice, and intransit inventory receipts:**

1. Open the Receivings Transaction Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Receivings Transaction Entry)

2. Select the receipt. (You can find the receipt number on the Receivings Edit List you used to pinpoint the error.)

3. Highlight the fields you want to change and enter the correct information.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you changed a quantity shipped or quantity rejected for a lot-numbered item or a serial-numbered item, the Purchasing Lot Number Entry window or the Purchasing Serial Number Entry window will open; you can assign lot or serial numbers to the item. The In-Transit Serial Number Entry window or the In-Transit Lot Number Entry window opens for an in-transit inventory receipt, where you can assign lot or serial numbers to an item.

    - If receiving items without a purchase order is allowed, you can enter items, non-inventoried items or vendor items that don't exist on the purchase order. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't enter vendor items for projects.

    - If you delete an item when you are using landed costs, all line and apportioned landed costs assigned to the item also are deleted. Deleting an item that has apportioned landed costs will cause the unapportioned amount and the document's landed cost functional total to recalculate.

4. Choose File \>\> Print to verify the corrections you've entered with a Receivings Edit List.

5. Choose Save to save the corrected transaction.

### Correcting unposted invoice receipts

Use the Purchasing Invoice Entry window to correct invoice receipts before posting. After you enter receipts, print an edit list to determine if the entries contain errors. (You can print edit lists only for receipts entered in a batch.) If you discover that an unposted receipt was entered incorrectly, you can correct the error using the following procedure.

**To correct unposted invoice receipts:**

1. Open the Purchasing Invoice Entry window.
    (Purchasing \>\> Transactions \>\> Enter/Match Invoices)

2. Select the receipt. (You can find the receipt number on the Purchasing Invoice Edit List you used to pinpoint the error.)

3. Highlight the fields you want to change and enter the correct information.

    - If receiving items without a purchase order is allowed, you can enter items, non-inventoried items, or vendor items that don't exist on the purchase order as long as those items or vendor items are on a shipment that has been posted. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't enter vendor items for projects.

    - You can match or unmatch shipment line items to invoices. You also can match or unmatch landed cost items.

4. Choose File \>\> Print to verify the corrections you've entered with a Purchasing Invoice Edit List.

5. Choose Save to save the corrected transaction.

### About deleting and voiding receipts

Deleting and voiding receipts reduces the following quantities in the Purchasing Quantity Status window:

- Unposted shipment

- Unposted invoice

- Unposted rejected quantities

- Unposted matched quantities

Deleting and voiding receipts increases the following quantities in the Purchasing Quantity Status window:

- Remaining to ship quantity. (This quantity will be increased by the quantity shipped minus the quantity rejected. The remaining to ship quantity is the remaining to receive quantity for in-transit inventory receipts.)

- Remaining to invoice quantities. (These quantities will be increased by the quantity invoiced.)

- Remaining posted shipments to match quantities. (These quantities will be increased by the quantity invoiced when you void or delete an unposted invoice receipt.)

### Deleting shipment, shipment/invoice, or in-transit inventory receipts

Use the Receivings Transaction Entry window to delete unposted shipment. shipment/invoice, or in-transit inventory receipts. Deleting removes receipt information from the system and makes receipt numbers available for reuse.

To delete receipts or line items linked to jobs, you must have authority to unlink line items from a job. Security is set in the Job Costing Preference Defaults window. You can't link line item jobs to in-transit inventory receipts. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't link line items to jobs.

Voiding moves receipt information to history and does not make receipt numbers available for reuse until history is removed, if you're keeping history. If you're not keeping history, voiding removes receipt information from the system.

If you track voided receipts, you'll know why a receipt number is missing or out of sequence. If you've selected to track receipts in history, you can view information about voided receipts using the purchasing inquiry windows or by printing the Receivings Voided Journal or the Receivings Transaction History Report.

To void receipts or line items linked to jobs, you must have authority to unlink line items from a job. Security is set in the Job Costing Preference Defaults window. You can't link line item jobs to in-transit inventory receipts. If you are using Project Accounting, you can't link line items to jobs.
