# Manufacturing Setup - Check data and correct errors

This part of the documentation includes information that will help you verify the setup on the  Manufacturing module in Dynamics GP by running the Microsoft Dynamics Manufacturing Checkdata stored procedure.

The Checkdata stored procedure is designed to evaluate various manufacturing tables and report back any inconsistencies it discovers.  This would include issues with imported data, issue with rolling up cost, and issue with manufacturing orders and costing.  It will not make any changes to any manufacturing table.  It is not version specific and can be run on any versions of Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## To run the Checkdata stored procedure

To run this, open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and run the following statement against the company database:

1. In Object Explorer, expand Databases, and then click on your company database.  
2. Click New Query, and then type the following select statement in the query pane:

    ```sql
    Exec mfgfix90checkdata
    ```

3. On the Query menu, point to Results To, and then click Results to Text.
4. On the Query menu, click Execute.

## How do you correct the reported errors

Once you have the results of the script in text form use the Error Listing below to correct them accordingly.  This Error Listing will list all the possible errors the script may return.  If the error has an asterisk next to it this means that it is a serious error and must be corrected to avoid further problems.  If the error does not have an asterisk by it you will want to look at the information returned and verify it is accurate.  These errors are more informational type errors and may or may not be a problem depending on how your manufacturing information is set up.  The errors are listed in alphabetical order.  

## Error Listing

1. ALLOCATE QUANTITY DOES NOT EQUAL TRANSACTION QUANTITY ON ALLOCATES PICK DOC

    There are records in the MOP_PickDoc_Line (MOP1210) for pick documents with Allocate transactions where the Quantity Allocated (ATYALLOC) and Transaction Quantity (TRXQTY) values are not the same.

    Resolution:  
    Go to Component Transaction Inquiry (Inquiry | Manufacturing | Manufacturing | Component Transaction Inquiry), pull up the MO in question, and determine what the correct allocation quantity is.  Use SQL to update the table to reflect the correct quantity.

    To check for the table for each of the quantities run the following script.

    ```sql
    select * from MOP1210 where TRXQTY<>ATYALLOC and TRX_TYPE=3
    ```

    To update the transaction quantity in the MOP1210, run the following script

    ```sql
    Update MOP1210 set set ATYALLOC=TRXQTY where TRXQTY<>ATYALLOC and TRX_TYPE = 3
    ```

2. ARCHIVED OR CONFIGURED BOM WITH NO BOM NAME

    There is an Archived or Configured BOM without a BOM Name.

    Resolution:
    Every Archived or Configured BOM must have a BOM Name.  

    Use SQL to update the Bill of Material Line table (BM010115) and BOM Revision table (BM010415).  

    Once the table has been updated go to BOM Entry (Cards | Manufacturing | Bill of Materials), pull up the Archived or Configured BOM, and either correct the BOM name or delete the BOM.

    To update the BOM name in the BM010115 table run the following script.  

    ```sql
    Update BM010115 set BOMNAME_I='xxxx' where (BOMCAT_I=4 or BOMCAT_I=3)and BOMNAME_i=''
    ```

    To update the BOM name in the BM010415 table run the following script.

    ```sql
    Update BM010415 set BOMNAME_I='xxxx' where (BOMCAT_I=4 or BOMCAT_I=3)and BOMNAME_i=''
    ```

3. ARCHIVED OR CONFIGURED SUBASSEMBLY COMPONENT WITH NO BOM NAME

    There is a subassembly component BOM assigned to a BOM with a BOM Type of Archived or Configured that has no BOM Name.  

    Resolution:
    Every Archived or Configured BOM must have a BOM Name.  

    Use SQL to update the record in both the Bill of Material Line table (BM010115) and BOM Revision table (BM010415).  

    Once the table has been updated go to BOM Entry (Cards | Manufacturing | Bill of Materials), pull up the Archived or Configured BOM, and either correct the BOM name or delete the BOM.  

    To update the BOM name in the BM010115 table run the following script.  

    ```sql
    Update BM010115 set BOMNAME_I='xxxx' where(BOMCAT_I=4 or BOMCAT_I=3)and BOMNAME_i=''
    ```

    To update the BOM Name in the BM010415 table run the following script.

    ```sql
    Update BM010415 set BOMNAME_I='xxxx' where(BOMCAT_I=4 or BOMCAT_I=3)and BOMNAME_i=''
    ```

4. BOM CHILD MISSING ITEM MASTER RECORD  

    There is a child part item number defined in the Bill of Material Line table (BM010115) table does not have a corresponding Item Master (IV00101) record.  

    Resolution:
    Either go to the Item Maintenance (Cards | Inventory | Item) window to create the item number, or use SQL to remove all occurrences of that item from Bill of Material Line table (BM010115) and BOM Revision table (BM010415).  

    To determine the records in the BM010115 run the following script.  

    To update the BM010415 replace the BM010115 with the BM010415 in the below scripts.  

    ```sql
    select * from BM010115 where CPN_I not in (select ITEMNMBR from IV00101)
    ```

    To delete the records from the BM010115 run the following script.  This is sample text.  This is sample text.  This is sample text.  

    ```sql
    delete BM010115 where CPN_I not in (select ITEMNMBR from IV00101)
    ```

5. BOM EFFECTIVE DATE IN THE FUTURE

    There are items where the Effective Date on a BOM is after the current date.

    Resolution:
    Go to the BOM Entry (Cards | Manufacturing | Bill of Materials) window, pull up the item in question, and verify/change the Effective Date.

6. BOM EXISTS FOR BOUGHT ITEM

    There is a component item where the parent item for a BOM has a Make/Buy code of Buy.  

    Resolution:

    If the BOM is an Archived or Engineering BOM, this message can be ignored.  
    If the BOM is a Manufacturing BOM, go to the BOM Entry (Cards | Manufacturing | Bill of Materials) window, and either move the BOM to an Archived status, or delete it.

7. BOM LINE IN DATE IN THE FUTURE

    There is BOM and component information when a component In-Date on the BOM is after the current date.

    Resolution:
    Go to the BOM Entry (Cards | Manufacturing | Bill of Materials) window, and verify the In-Date for the component in question.

    Resolution:
    Verify that all adjustments from Manufacturing have completely posted through the Inventory subledger.  Determine if this issue is impacting only one MO or numerous MOs.  If this is more than one MO look for trends to determine what is causing the issue.  Many times these types of issues are caused by posting interruptions.  Watch when you close the MO.  There may be variances caused by incorrect values in this table.  If this variance is not correct do not post the variance to GL or if it was posted do a manual GL adjustment to correct the value.  

28. COSTS IN TABLE MOP1002 NOT EQUAL TO COSTS PUT INTO WIP's

    There are records in the MOP_WIP_Costs table (MOP1002) where the WIP In and/or WIP Out Costs for the MO differ with the Inventory history tables (IV30300 in particular).  

    Resolution:
    Verify that all adjustments from Manufacturing have completely posted through the Inventory subledger.  Determine if this issue is impacting only one MO or numerous MO's.  If this is more than one MO look for trends to determine what is causing the issue.  Many times these types of issues are caused by posting interruptions.  Watch when you close the MO.  There may be variances caused by incorrect values in this table.  If this variance is not correct do not post the variance to GL or if it was posted do a manual GL adjustment to correct the value.  

29. COSTS USED IN MOP1010 NOT EQUAL TO SUM OF RECEIPT COSTS
    There are records in the MOP WIP Labor and Machine table (MOP1010) where the Costs Used does not equal the sum of the costs recorded in the MOP_Receipt_MSTR table (MOP1100) for the same MO.  

    Resolution:
    Determine if this issue is impacting only one MO or numerous MOs.  If this is more than one MO look for trends to determine what is causing the issue.  Many times these types of issues are caused by posting interruptions.  Watch when you close the MO.  There may be variances caused by incorrect values in this table.  If this variance is not correct do not post the variance to GL or if it was posted do a manual GL adjustment to correct the value.  

30. DATA COLLECTION RECORDS IN WHICH THE SUM OF THE DC LINES<> DC MASTER TABLE

    There are records in the Data Collection MSTR table (SF010014) where the Elapsed Time or the collected costs do not match the Data Collection Line Items table (SF010115) for the same MO and sequence.  

    Resolution:
    Verify that the Data Collection line item information (SF010115) is correct and complete.  You can view this in the table or in Great Plains in the Data Collection Summary window (Inquiry | Manufacturing | WIP | DC Summary) and then drill down on sequence information to the Data Collection Summary – Direct Labor window.  If the information in the Data Collection Line Items table (SF010115) is correct MBS Professional Services will need to be contacted to correct.

31. DOCDATE EMPTY EXISTS IN MOP1200

    There are pick documents in the MOP_PickDoc_MSTR table (MOP1200)that do not have a valid Docdate (document date).  

    Resolution:
    Check the MOP_PickDoc_Line table (MOP1210) for this PICKNUMBER.  If there are lines for is pick document number use SQL to update the MOP_PickDoc_MSTR table (MOP1200) with the correct date.  If there are no records in the MOP_PickDoc_Line table (MOP1210) related to this pick document number use SQL to remove the line from the MOP_PickDoc_MSTR table (MOP1200).  In order to delete the record from the MOP1200, you must know the pick document number.  Replace the XXX below with the pick document number in question.  First there is a select statement.  Next there is a delete statement.

    To determine the records in the MOP1200 run the following script.

    ```sql
    select * from MOP1200 where PICKNUMBER = 'XXX' and PICKNUMBER not in (select PICKNUMBER from MOP1210)
    ```

    To remove the records from the MOP1200 run the following script.

    ```sql
