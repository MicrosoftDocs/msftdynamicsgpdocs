# Glossary of Terms in the Invoicing Area in Dynamics GP

The following table explains the terminology used in the Distribution area in Dynamics GP.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|--|--|
| Account | The type of record—asset, liability, revenue, expense, or owner's equity—traditionally used for recording individual transactions in an accounting system. Also, the identifying alphanumeric characters that have been assigned to the record. *See also Posting account*. |
| Account alias | A "short name" for a posting account in the chart of accounts. If the account format has a large number of segments, using aliases can speed data entry. |
| Accounting period | A subdivision of the fiscal year. Common periods are months or quarters. |
| Active customer | A user with whom business is conducted on a regular basis. |
| Alert message | A message that appears when inappropriate, inadequate, or unclear data or instructions are issued, when data is not accessible or when a confirmation is sought. Additional information about some alert messages and their causes can be viewed by choosing the Help button in the alert message dialog box. |
| Alignment form | A document that ensures text will be properly aligned when statements are printed. |
| Application | A software program designed to perform particular tasks through the use of one or more windows. *See also Module*. |
| Audit trail | A series of permanent records used to track a transaction to the point where it was originally entered in Microsoft Dynamics GP. The audit trail can be used to verify the accuracy of financial statements by outside accountants |
| or auditors. |
| Audit trail code | A series of alphanumeric characters providing a precise record of each transaction and where it has been posted within Microsoft Dynamics GP. |
| Bank card | A card, such as VISA or Master Card. Bank cards differ from charge cards, such as American Express, because payments can be treated as cash by the business that receives the payment. |
| Batch | A group of transactions identified by a unique name or number. Batches are used in computerized accounting to conveniently group transactions, both for identification purposes and to speed the posting process. |
| Batch approval | Allows users to choose whether to approve batches of transactions before |
| posting. If the batch approval option is being used, the ID of the user who |
| approved the batch and the approval date will appear on posting reports.Batch controls | Values for both the number of transactions in a batch and the total currency amount of the batch. As transactions are entered, the actual totals will be |
| displayed. These totals can be verified periodically as transactions are entered to ensure that the required number and amount of transactions match the actual number and amount that was entered. |
| Batch frequency | A selection in many batch entry windows that determines how often a recurring batch will be posted, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Invoicing batches must be single-use. |
| Batch posting | An option used to post a group of transactions identified by a unique name or number in the Invoice Batch Entry window. |
| Batch-level posting | A posting method you can use to save transactions in batches and post the batches whenever it's convenient. There are three types of batch-level posting: batch posting, series posting, and master posting. *See also Series posting*. |
| Calendar year | An accounting period running from January 1 to December 31. |
| Calendar-year history | A record of transactions by calendar months. |
| Cash | Ready money or its equivalent that a bank will accept at face value. Cash includes coins; paper money; certain deposited negotiable instruments such as checks, bank drafts, and money orders; amounts in checking and savings accounts; and demand certificates of deposit. |
| Cash receipt | A document used to record payments and deposits received from users. |
| Charge card | A type of credit card. Charge cards are issued by banks and authorize the holder to buy goods or services on credit. Payments received from charge cards are treated as accounts receivable amounts, because you must submit them to the card companies for reimbursement.

| Check card | A type of credit card. When purchases are made with a check card, the amount of purchase will be immediately withdrawn from the user's bank account. |
| Checkbook | An account used to maintain a currency balance and track the receiving and disbursing of cash. |

| Commission | The amount, usually a percentage of the sale amount, paid to the salesperson making the sale. |
| Credit card | Cards used to pay for items instead of a check, cash, or other method. The amount due is then billed by the credit card company.
