>   This part of the documentation includes information for the accounting
>   manager about how to create batches for transactions, how to review and
>   modify posting account distributions for transactions in batches, and how to
>   post batches.

>   The following topics are discussed.

-   *Manually create a batch for transactions*

-   *Review and modify posting account distributions for transactions*

-   *Post batches*

#### Manually create a batch for transactions

>   You can create batches manually for grouping cost, return from project,
>   billing, and revenue recognition transactions. You can save transactions in
>   batches and then post the entire batch of transactions at once.

>   Batches that you create manually in Project Accounting always use the
>   **Single Use** frequency, meaning the batch is used once and is deleted
>   after the batch is posted.

>   *You can use billing cycles and revenue recognition cycles to create batches
>   of billing and revenue recognition transactions. For more information, see
>   Use a revenue recognition cycle to generate revenue recognition transactions
>   and Use a billing cycle to generate billing invoices of the Project
>   Accounting Billing Guide.*

#### Accounting methods and recognizing revenue

>   Revenue is recognized for a project based on the accounting method used for
>   the project. You must select the default accounting method to use for new
>   projects in a contract, and you can select the accounting method to use for
>   individual projects.

>   See *Create a contract record* and *Create a project record* in the Project
>   Accounting Cost Management Guide for more information.

>   **Completed**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Cost Plus** or **Fixed Price** project that
>   uses the

>   **Completed** accounting method when the project status has been changed to
>   **Completed** for all projects in the contract that the project is for. The
>   Project Revenue account will be updated on the Profit and Loss Statement.

>   **Cost-to-Cost**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Cost Plus** or **Fixed Price** project that
>   uses the **Cost-toCost** accounting method when you post revenue recognition
>   transactions for the project. Revenue will be determined by comparing total
>   actual project costs to total forecast project costs. See *Percentage
>   complete and revenue recognition calculations* for more information.

>   **Effort-Expended**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Cost Plus** or **Fixed Price** project that
>   uses the **EffortExpended** accounting method when you post revenue
>   recognition transactions for the project. Revenue will be determined by
>   comparing total actual project quantities to total forecast project
>   quantities. See *Percentage complete and revenue recognition calculations*
>   for more information.

>   **Effort-Expended Labor Only**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Cost Plus** or **Fixed Price** project that
>   uses the **EffortExpended Labor Only** accounting method when you post
>   revenue recognition transactions for the project. Revenue will be determined
>   by comparing total actual time quantities entered on timesheets to total
>   forecast time quantities for the project. See *Percentage complete and
>   revenue recognition calculations* for more information.

>   **When Billed**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Time and Materials** project that uses the
>   **When Billed** accounting method when you post a billing invoice for the
>   project. The Cost of Goods Sold account will be updated on the Profit and
>   Loss Statement and the Work In Progress account will be updated on the
>   Balance Sheet.

>   **When Performed**

>   Revenue is recognized for a **Time and Materials** project that uses the
>   **When**

>   **Performed** accounting method when you post a cost transaction for the
>   project. The Cost of Goods Sold account will be updated on the Profit and
>   Loss Statement.

#### Percentage complete and revenue recognition calculations

>   The amount of revenue that you will recognize for a **Cost Plus** or **Fixed
>   Price** project and for the contract that the project is for depends on how
>   you’ve selected to calculate revenue.

>   The default method for recognizing revenue is to recognize revenue based on
>   the percentage complete calculation for individual cost categories in a
>   project budget. This is the **Segmented** revenue recognition calculation
>   method.

>   The percentage that a cost category is complete is based on the actual total
>   costs incurred for the cost category divided by the forecast budgeted costs
>   for the cost category. For example, if you have forecasted that you will
>   spend \$10,000 on outsourced administrative costs for a project and you have
>   spent \$7,500 to date, the percentage complete is 75%.

>   However, you can recognize revenue for a project based on the average
>   percentage complete calculation for all cost categories in the project
>   budget. You can select **Combine for Revenue Recognition** in the Project
>   Maintenance window to indicate that you will recognize revenue for the
>   project in this way. This is the **Combined from Project** revenue
>   recognition calculation method. See *Create a project record* in the Project
>   Accounting Cost Management Guide for more information.

>   You also can recognize revenue for a contract based on the average
>   percentage complete calculation for all projects in the contract. You can
>   select **Combine for Revenue Recognition** in the Contract Maintenance
>   window to indicate that you will recognize revenue for the contract in this
>   way. This is the **Combined from Contract** revenue recognition calculation
>   method. See *Create a contract record* in the Project Accounting Cost
>   Management Guide for more information.

#### Use a revenue recognition cycle to generate revenue recognition transactions

>   You can use a revenue recognition cycle to generate a batch of revenue
>   recognition transactions to recognize revenue for multiple customers,
>   contracts, and projects at one time. See *Create a revenue recognition cycle
>   record* for more information.

>   Revenue recognition is for **Cost Plus** and **Fixed Price** projects, and
>   for **Service** fees used in **Time and Materials** projects.

>   You can generate revenue recognition transactions for **Open**,
>   **Completed**, or **Closed** contracts and projects. See *Contract, project,
>   and cost category statuses* in the Project Accounting Cost Management Guide
>   for more information.

>   Group** list and click **Print**.

#### Report destinations and formats

>   You can print reports to a printer, the screen, a file, or a combination of
>   these destinations.

-   If you print to the printer, the report is printed to the default printer
    that’s been set up for your operating system, unless the report has been
    assigned to a named printer. Refer to the “Printers” chapter in the System
    Administrator’s Guide (**Help \> Printable Manuals**) for more information.

-   If you print to the screen, the report appears on the screen and you then
    can choose to print to the printer. In addition, if you’re using an e-mail
    system that’s compliant with MAPI (Microsoft’s Messaging Application Program
    Interface), you can send any report that you print to the screen in an
    e-mail message.

-   If you print to a file, you can select a file format.

>   The following table lists more information about the file formats that you
>   can select.

| **File format** | **Description**      |
