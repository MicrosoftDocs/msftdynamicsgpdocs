#### The bill of materials trace tree view

The Serial/Lot Bill of Materials Trace window uses a tree view to show the serial numbers, lot numbers, and transactions in a bill of materials trace. To view information in the tree view, select a trace type and choose Redisplay.

The trace type you select determines the information that is displayed in the tree view.

- If you select Consumed into the serial/lot as the trace type, you can view serial- or lot-numbered items that were consumed (used) in a serial- or lot-numbered item.

- If you select Produced from the serial/lot as the trace type, you can view serial- or lot-numbered items that were produced (assembled) from a serial- or lotnumbered item.

##### Objects in the tree view

Each line in the tree is called an object. When you select an object in the tree view, the information to the right of the window displays the information about the selected object.

The first object in the tree view is the serial or lot number that you are tracing, followed by the item number. The next object or objects are the transactions that consumed (used) or produced (assembled) serial- and lot-numbered items for the serial or lot number being traced. The following is an example of a tree view.

\- SERIAL10 : CIRCUIT BOARD + ASM00078

You can choose the + symbol next to a manufacturing or assembly transaction object to view additional levels in the tree view. You can collapse and expand the entire tree or just portions of it.

If a lot number is used multiple times on a transaction, each occurrence of the lot number will be displayed in the tree view, as shown in the following example.

\- LOT 10 : CIRCUIT BOARD - ASM00038 - LOT 55 : SWITCH SYSTEM ORDER005 INV015 ADJ029 + LOT 55 : SWITCH SYSTEM

If an item doesn't track serial or lot numbers, that information will be displayed in the tree view, as shown in the following example.

\- LOT 12 : ITEM - ASM00038 \<Not Tracked\> : Brush

For assembly transactions, a link icon might appear next to a specific serial or lot number that is matched to another serial or lot number, as shown in the following example.

\- LOT 10 : CIRCUIT BOARD - ASM00038 +

![Screenshot showing a link.](media/a7035a7282d50e7c24fcbd0c6872714c.jpg)

### Chapter 28: Extended pricing inquiries

If you're using extended pricing, you can trace how prices are calculated in your pricing structures. You also can view information about price sheets: the items and price groups that are assigned to a price sheet, and the customers, prospects, and price books that a price sheet is assigned to.

Some extended pricing information is better viewed with a report. To check pricing structures for missing prices, for example, you can use the Extended Pricing Error Reports window. Refer to *Checking for missing prices*.

*If you're using standard pricing, refer to Chapter 27, "Standard pricing inquiries," for information about viewing pricing information.*

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Tracing a price calculation*

- *Originating currency errors in price trace inquiries*

- *Viewing the items and price groups in a price sheet*

- *Viewing price sheets for a selected item or price group*

- *Viewing promotions for a prospect or customer*

#### Tracing a price calculation

Use the Price Trace Inquiry window to find out how an item's price is calculated for a customer. You can use this window to view the total price, the steps taken to calculate the price, and the price sheets used to calculate the price. This is useful if you want to test the pricing structure before you enter transactions in the Sales Transaction Entry window.

The number of currency decimals used to display information in the Price Trace Inquiry window depends on the source of the information.

- If pricing information comes from a price group, the net price and any adjustments to it are displayed with the number of currency decimals that have been specified for the price group.

- If the pricing information comes from the items, the net price and any adjustments to it are displayed with the number of currency decimals that have been specified for the item.

- The Unit Price and Promotion Unit Price information must be displayed with the number of currency decimals from the item. These fields also must match the Unit Price information for a sales document in the Sales Transaction Entry window.

**To trace a price calculation:**

1. Open the Price Trace Inquiry window.
(Inventory \>\> Inquiry \>\> Extended Pricing \>\> Price Trace)

![Screenshot of the Price Trace Inquiry window.](media/8a3e68609967346f4662af725541c1cc.jpg)

2. Select Customer or Prospect, and enter or select a customer ID or prospect ID.

3. Enter or select a currency ID.

4. Enter or select an item number.

5. Select a unit of measure.

6. Enter a quantity, if you want. The quantity is used if quantity break pricing is set up for the selected item. The price per item will be calculated.

*If a promotion exists for the item and quantity-break pricing is used on the promotional price sheet, it won't be displayed in the Price Trace Inquiry window if the quantity is zero or blank.*

7. Enter a date for the price inquiry.

8. Choose Trace. The total price, steps taken to calculate the price, and the price sheets used will be displayed in the Price Trace Results scrolling window. If a promotion is available, information about it also is displayed.

Any errors encountered while calculating the price will be displayed in the

Price Trace Error field. Click the Price Sheet ID link to open the Price Sheet

Detail Maintenance window, where you can correct the errors. If you're using Multicurrency Management, you might have errors for the originating currency. Refer to *Originating currency errors in price trace inquiries* for more information.

#### Originating currency errors in price trace inquiries

Price-trace errors—errors in how prices for items are calculated when you're using extended pricing—can be reported for the originating currency in certain situations.

If you've marked the Sales Order Processing setup option so that a price isn't required for each currency for an item, and if you've marked the option to convert the originating currency to the functional currency, then pricing calculations are "round-tripped" from the originating currency to the functional currency and back to the originating currency.

For example, suppose you've created price sheets for US dollars, but haven't created them for British pounds. If you have these options marked, you could enter a price trace inquiry in British pounds. The inquiry would calculate the pricing in US dollars, then convert it to British pounds based on your exchange tables.

Rules for price sheets still apply: you can't use two price sheets with identical date ranges, and you must have a net price for the items. If either of these rules are broken—and if you're using the "round-tripping" calculations—then the Originating Currency Errors button will appear on the Price Trace Inquiry window.

You can choose that button to open the Price Trace Originating Currency Trace window, where you can view information about the errors.

![Screenshot of the Price Trace Originating Currency Trace window.](media/071e40940aee41f2d63e8332f7c207b1.jpg)

When you've finished viewing information, choose OK to close the window.

For example, you might want to know the effect of a value off the base price at a date in the future, or you might want to set up a record for a customer who receives discounts from a price book other than the base book.

### Chapter 30: Reports

You can use Inventory Control reports to analyze inventory activity and identify errors in transaction entry. Use this information to guide you through printing reports and working with report options.

For more information about creating and printing reports, and the various reporting tools that you can use with Microsoft Dynamics GP, refer to your System User's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Using The System).

The following information is discussed:

- *Inventory Control report summary*

- *Accuracy Comparison report*

- *Historical stock status report*

- *Checking for missing prices*

- *Printing extended pricing summary reports*

- *Printing a purchase order generator item report*

- *Specifying an Inventory Control report option*

- *Microsoft SQL Server&reg; Reporting Services reports for Inventory Control*

#### Inventory Control report summary

You can print several types of reports using Inventory Control. Some reports automatically are printed when you complete certain procedures; for example, posting journals can be printed automatically when you post transactions, depending on how your posting options are set up. You can choose to print some reports during procedures; for example, you can print an edit list when entering transactions by choosing the Print button in the batch entry window. In order to print some reports, such as analysis or history reports, you must set up report options to specify sorting options and ranges of information to include on the report. For more information, refer to *Specifying an Inventory Control report option*.

*If you're using extended pricing, standard item price list reports won't contain up-to-date pricing information. To print an accurate pricing report, you must use the Extended Pricing Reports window.*

The following table lists the report types available in Inventory Control and the reports in each category.

| **Report Type**                                                                    | **Report**                   | **Printing method**                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Accuracy Comparison report

The Accuracy Comparison report can be the most valuable result of performing stock counts. The report helps you spot trends in the accuracy of your inventory records over time, measured by the results of your stock counts.

For example, suppose your business has several warehouses and stores. For each site, you implement cycle counting and stock counts. Once you've completed several counts, you print the Accuracy Comparison report, which shows that all sites and warehouses have about the same inventory-record accuracy.

If you notice a sharp decrease in the accuracy at one site, you might need to investigate further. The change could be caused by changes in how inventory is managed at that site—perhaps more training is needed for those inventory personnel—or might be caused by employee theft. If you implement new inventory management policies, the Accuracy comparison report also can help you measure the success of those changes.

The Accuracy Comparison report is printed from the Inventory Analysis Reports window. You can print the report any time, but you must have processed at least one stock count for the report to include any data.

The following fields are of particular importance when analyzing your accuracy.

**To Reconcile** This field displays the absolute difference between the captured quantity and the counted quantity. Ideally, this difference should be zero, meaning that the captured quantity and the counted quantity are the same. A large number in this field doesn't necessarily mean that there was a large variance, however. If unposted transactions or transaction history showed that other entries in the system accounted for the amount, then your inventory records are still accurate.

**Net Variance** This field is the item quantity that was actually included in the variance transaction. A large number in this field might signify inventory control problems.

**Accuracy % [Accuracy Percent]** The Accuracy Percent is 100% - Relative Error Percent, where Relative Error Percent is Variance / Counted Quantity x 100. An accuracy percentage of 100.00% is perfect accuracy.

**Approx Value** Extended values for all quantities—captured, counted, to reconcile, and net variance—are the current cost of the item when the stock count was processed.

#### Historical stock status report

The Historical Stock Status Report can be printed at any time for a report of the status of your inventory on a certain day. You can print the report using the Inventory Activity Reports window. To automatically print the report, you can use Named Printers or the Distributed Process Server (DPS). Refer to your System Administrator's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select System Administration) for more information.

The report can be used to report information about Sales Inventory and Discontinued items only. The report shows the quantity on hand, the unit cost, and the extended cost for each item. Information about returned, damaged, in use, and service quantities is not reflected in the report.

*To generate a Historical Stock Status Report, you must be maintaining transaction history for the items in the report. To set options to maintain history for an item class, refer to Creating an item class. To set options to maintain history for an item, refer to Entering item options.*

For an item with a LIFO Perpetual valuation method or a FIFO Perpetual valuation method, the extended cost of inventory as of a certain day is calculated in two steps. First, the extended cost is calculated *at the time the report is run*, much like the regular Stock Status Report. Then, transactions posted since the "as of date" are added to or subtracted from the extended cost. However, only transactions that affect the quantity on hand are listed in the report. A transaction that affected a different quantity type—such as a sales return document that added items to the returned quantity—would not be included in the report.

Inventory cost (extended cost) calculations for the Historical Stock Status Report are influenced by the valuation method for an item. For more information about valuation methods and item costs, refer to *Valuation methods*.

*If you change the valuation method for an item sometime between the point in time you choose for the report—the As of Date—and the date you generate the report, values in the report might not be accurate.*

Refer to the following table for more information.

| **Valuation method** | **Calculation**                                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| FIFO perpetual       | Layered cost using purchase receipts                           |
| LIFO perpetual       | Layered cost using purchase receipts                           |
| Average perpetual    | Quantity x Item's historical current cost for a selected date  |
| FIFO periodic        | Quantity x Item's historical standard cost for a selected date |
| LIFO periodic        | Quantity x Item's historical standard cost for a selected date |

When the current cost of an item that uses average perpetual valuation method changes or when the standard cost of a LIFO periodic or FIFO periodic item changes, the new value is saved to history. When an item that uses LIFO perpetual or FIFO perpetual valuation method is received into stock, the transaction is valued at the actual cost. This becomes the "historical cost" for the item. The historical cost is always used for both increase transactions (receipts) and decrease transactions (issues) for items that have a LIFO Perpetual or FIFO Perpetual valuation method.

If your report includes items with an Average Perpetual or periodic valuation methods, however, you can choose to use either the historical cost or the standard cost (for items with periodic valuation methods) or the average cost (for items with the Average Cost valuation method). In those cases, the unit costs and extended values are calculated according to the following table:

| **Valuation method**                                                   | **Cost type used** | **Calculations \***                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Checking for missing prices

If you're using extended pricing, you can use the Extended Pricing Error Report to identify the items for which prices cannot be calculated.

For example, if an item has a value-off price in a price sheet but no net price in the base price book, or if an item has entries in two price sheets with the same date range in the same price book, prices can't be calculated and errors will be reported.

You can view price error results on screen or on a printed report. When a pricing error report is generated, a complete price book is calculated for the date you enter. This price book is recalculated when an Extended Pricing report is generated for a different date or if the Refresh Pricing Tables option is marked.

**To check for missing prices:**

1. Open the Extended Pricing Error Report window.
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Extended Pricing \>\> Error Reports)

![Screenshot of the Extended Pricing Error Report window.](media/546c8a7ba62e2dd0ee1feabc97e157cd.jpg)

2. Choose to report on errors for customers or price books.

3. Enter a date for which prices will be calculated.

4. Mark the Refresh Pricing Tables option to recalculate the prices in the price book when you generate the Extended Pricing error report.

*If you intend to produce multiple price book reports for the same date, clear this option to reduce processing time. Select this option only if you have made changes to pricing setup since the last report was printed.*

5. If you selected a Customer report type, choose to report on customers or prospects.

6. Enter or select the range of customers, prospects, or price books you want to print the report for.

7. Choose where to look for prices.

A customer report can be printed using the following options:

| **Option**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Price Sheets Only                      | Prices will be reported for price sheets assigned directly to the customer or prospect.                                                                                                                  |
| Price Sheets and Price Book            | Prices will be reported for price sheets assigned directly to the customer or prospect, and price sheets assigned to the customer or prospect's price book.                                              |
| Price Sheets, Price Book and Base Book | Prices will be reported for price sheets assigned directly to the customer or prospect, price sheets assigned to the customer or prospect's price book, and price sheets assigned to the base price book. |

A price book report can be printed using the following options:

| **Option**               | **Description**                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Price Book Only          | Prices will be reported for price sheets assigned to the price book.                                                 |

(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Extended Pricing \>\> Pricing Reports)

![Screenshot of the Extended Pricing Report window.](media/ee9c7b195ca5b21478533bb52969e19a.jpg)

2. Choose the report type: Customer or Price Book.

*You can use the customer report type to print reports for prospects, as well.*

3. Mark Refresh Pricing Tables to recalculate pricing in a price book. You shouldn't have to mark this option unless you have made changes to pricing information since the last time you generated the report.

2. Enter the date that information in the report should be based on.

3. Mark Print Errors if problems in calculating prices should be included in the report.

If you don't mark this option, the first net price that is found will be printed on the report.

4. If you're using Multicurrency Management, enter or select the currency ID for the report. If you don't select a currency, information about all currencies will be included on the report.

#### Specifying an Inventory Control report option

Report options include specifications for sorting options and range restrictions for a particular report. In order to print several Inventory Control reports, you must first create a report option. Each report can have several different options so that you can easily print the information you need. For example, you can create report options for the Purchase Receipts Report that show either detailed or summary information.

*A single report option can't be used by multiple reports. If you want identical options for several reports, you must create them separately.*

Use the Inventory Control report options windows to create sorting, restriction, printing, and email options for the reports that have been included with Inventory Control.

**To specify an Inventory Control report option:**

1. Open an Inventory Control reports window. There are separate windows for each report type.
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Setup)
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Item)
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Serial/Lots)
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Activity)
(Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Analysis)

## Part 5: Utilities

This part of the documentation contains the procedures you need for maintaining setup options, correcting transaction errors, and maintaining your data. Always back up your accounting data before performing these procedures.

The following information is discussed:

- *Chapter 31, "Item cost adjustments,"* contains information about updating cost information on posted purchase receipts, and about updating average or standard cost information for an item.

- *Chapter 32, "Standard pricing wizards,"* describes how you can use wizards to work with price list records, if you're using standard pricing. You can add, copy, update, and remove price lists. You also can assign a currency to a range of items, if you're using Multicurrency Management.

- *Chapter 33, "Extended pricing utilities,"* contains information about utilities you can use to transfer and remove price sheets.

- *Chapter 34, "History utilities,"* includes information about removing fiscal- and calendar-year history, as well as removing other inventory history information: for transactions, distributions, posting journals, and stock counts.

- *Chapter 35, "Reconciling inventory records,"* explains how you can reconcile inventory records so posted quantity information matches actual inventory levels.

- *Chapter 36, "Inventory Control setup changes,"* contains information about changing the number of decimal places used to track currency and quantity information for items. You also can change the valuation method assigned to an item, or replace the buyer or planner IDs that have been assigned in resource planning windows. You also can remove bins from sites, from item-site combinations, or both.

### Chapter 31: Item cost adjustments

You might need to adjust the costs of inventoried items in certain circumstances. For example, if you learn that the cost of an item in a posted transaction was entered incorrectly, you'll want to correct the information.

Certain situations also can cause inventory to be revalued. Those situations and their effect on accounts are included in this document.

*Refer to the General Ledger documentation for information about correcting General Ledger entries.*

The following information is discussed:

- *Adjusting the purchase receipt cost of an item*

- *Average cost updates*

- *Updating the standard cost of an item*

### Adjusting the purchase receipt cost of an item

Use the Inventory Adjust Costs window to change the cost information for a purchase receipt transaction.

**To adjust the purchase receipt cost of an item:**

1. Open the Inventory Adjust Costs window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Adjust Costs)

![Screenshot of the Inventory Adjust Costs window.](media/bafa6625fb134cda815132b3a94b1412.jpg)

2. Enter or select an item number.

3. Enter or select a site ID.

4. Determine the dates of the transactions you want to work with.

**To see transactions for all dates** Mark All.

**To see transactions for a specified period** Mark From, then enter starting and ending dates.

Once you've entered a range, detailed information for all receipts within the range are displayed in the scrolling window.

5. Find a transaction that has incorrect cost information. In the Cost column for the transaction line, enter the correct cost.

6. Continue, repeating step 5 to enter corrected costs for other transactions, if needed.

7. Choose Process.

The General Posting Journal will be printed if there are cost changes posted to the Inventory and Cost of Goods accounts in General Ledger. Cost changes can occur if a quantity of the receipt has already been sold or consumed.

### Average cost updates

When you create a record for an item that uses the average perpetual valuation method, you can enter an average cost for the item. The average cost is called the current cost in the Item Maintenance window. After you save the item record, the current cost will be updated when you post transactions for the item.

Microsoft Dynamics GP uses the moving average cost method. This means that when you post a transaction that increases the inventory quantity, the average cost will be calculated using the following formula.

(Previous On-Hand Quantity x Previous Adjusted Unit Cost) + [(Receipt Quantity - Quantity Returned) x Receipt Unit Cost]/Previous Quantity On-Hand + (Receipt's Quantity On-Hand - Quantity Returned)

*All calculations are based on quantities and costs that are first converted to the base unit of measure.*

The average cost of an item will be recalculated under the following situations.

- Posting an invoice receipt in Purchase Order Processing that has an item marked to be revalued in inventory and has a unit cost that is different from the unit cost on the shipment

- Using the Inventory Adjust Costs window to change the cost of a purchase receipt

- Closing a purchase order line item when you haven't invoiced the entire quantity of the item

- Posting a purchase order return

- Posting an increase or decrease transaction with a document date that causes the purchase receipt to appear before another purchase receipt in the Purchase Receipts Inquiry window

- Changing the quantity type of an item to On Hand when the unit cost for the transaction is different from the current cost of the item.

### Updating the standard cost of an item

Use the Change Item Standard Cost window utility to change the standard cost of an item and automatically create an adjustment in General Ledger keeping the inventory and accounts in balance.

Only certain items can be changed in this window:

- Items must be using a periodic valuation method

- Item status must be sales inventory or discontinued

- If you have the Manufacturing module registered, you will not be able to use this window. Use the windows available in that module instead.

**To update the standard cost of an item:**

1. Open the Change Item Standard Cost window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Change Item Standard Cost)

2. Enter or select the item. The quantity on hand and current standard cost will be displayed.

3. Enter the new standard cost.

4. Choose Process.

An adjusting transaction will be created for updating Inventory and General Ledger, and the standard cost will be changed. A posting journal will be printed with information about the change.

### Chapter 32: Standard pricing wizards

Inventory Control includes a series of wizards you can use to work with item price lists if you're using standard pricing. You can add a price list to a group of items, copy a price list from one item to another, and so on.

*For information about utilities available if you're using extended pricing, refer to Chapter 33, "Extended pricing utilities."*

Most of the information you need to use a wizard is included in the window, but you can refer to this information as needed for more information.

The following information is discussed:

- *Getting started with a price list wizard*

- *Adding a price list to several items*

- *Updating price lists for several items*

- *Fixed percentages versus percentages*

- *Rounding calculations for updating price lists*

- *Copying a price list from one item to others*

- *Removing price list records from several items*

- *Assigning a currency to a group of items*

- *Items updated by price list wizards*

### Getting started with a price list wizard

To use any of the price list wizards available in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you open a welcome window, move to a menu window, and select a price list procedure. All price list wizard features begin with these steps.

**To get started with a price list wizard:**

### Adding a price list to several items

You can use a price list wizard to add price list information to several items at once. To be able to do this, the items must be assigned the same price method. Refer to *Price methods* for more information.

You can end a price list wizard session at any time by choosing Cancel. Your records will be unchanged until you choose Finish in the last price list wizard window.

*Use this procedure only if you're using standard pricing. For information about pricing utilities you can use with extended pricing, refer to Chapter 33, "Extended pricing utilities."*

**To add a price list to several items:**

1. Refer to *Getting started with a price list wizard*, selecting the option for adding a price list to several items. The Add Price List Wizard - Price Method window opens.

2. Select a price method from the list. All items you're adding a price list to must share the same price method. Choose Next.

*To add price list records for multiple currencies to an item, you must be using Multicurrency Management and you must select Currency Amount or Percent of List for the price method, and the items must already have the appropriate currencies assigned to them.*

The window that appears depends on whether you're using multicurrency features and the price method you selected.

**If you're using Multicurrency Management and you selected percent of list or currency amount** The Add Price List Wizard - Currency and Price Level window opens.

**If you're not using multicurrency features** The Add Price List Wizard - Price Level window opens.

![Screenshot of the Add Price List Wizard - Finish window.](media/a42adfe0435da5d3a0daa6dfd3285b46.jpg)

Choose Finish to add the price lists to the items. The Add Price List Audit Report automatically will be generated.

### Updating price lists for several items

You can update price list records for a group of items that share a common price method. To be updated, the combination of currency, price level, unit of measure, and quantity breaks must already exist in each item's price list.

You can end a price list wizard session at any time by choosing Cancel. Your records will be unchanged until you choose Finish in the last price list wizard window.

*Use this procedure only if you're using standard pricing. For information about pricing utilities you can use with extended pricing, refer to Chapter 33, "Extended pricing utilities."*

**To update price lists for several items:**

1. Refer to *Getting started with a price list wizard*, selecting the wizard for updating a price list to several items. The Update Price List Wizard - Price Method window opens.

2. Select a price method, then choose Next.

3. In the Update Price List Wizard - Update Information window, indicate how the price list information should be updated.

**To adjust prices by a percentage** Mark Percentage and enter the percentage change. Choose Next.

**To adjust prices by a fixed percentage** Mark Fixed Percentage and enter the percentage change. Choose Next. This option isn't available if you're using the Currency Amount price method.

**To adjust prices by a fixed amount** This option is available only if you're using the Currency Amount price method. Mark Fixed Amount and enter the amount of increase or decrease. Choose Next.

*Refer to Fixed percentages versus percentages for more information.*

4. If you selected the Currency Amount price method, use the Update Price List Wizard - Rounding Information window to enter and select rounding options for the records you're updating. If you don't want rounding to occur, select None for the Round Policy. Choose Next.

![Screenshot of the Update Price List Wizard - Rounding Information window.](media/6c13fc5387a78a3eaf216fd748da2b27.jpg)

![Screenshot of the Update Price List Wizard - Finish window](media/f7187498cbb5034e754e43c2b3c43686.jpg)

Choose Finish to update the price lists. The Update Price List Audit Report automatically will be generated.

### Fixed percentages versus percentages

If you're updating price lists that have a price method based on a percentage—any price method other than Currency Amount—you can choose to specify either a fixed percentage or a percentage change. If you use the Fixed Percent update option, the percentage you enter is added to the percentage in each price list. If you use the Percent update option, the percentage in each price list is multiplied by the percentage you enter, and the result is added to the percentage in each price list.

Refer to the table for information about how those options will affect your price lists.

| Options                                                              | Fixed percentage | Percentage                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| If, before updating, the price method uses this percentage:   | 75%                  | 75%                                                |
| ... and the percent change entered in the wizard is ...      | 10%                  | 10%                                                |
| ... then the new percent used to calculate the price will be: | 85% 75% + 10% = 85%  | 82.5% (75% x 10%) + 75% = 82.5% 7.5% + 75% = 82.5% |

### Rounding calculations for updating price lists

You can use rounding options to make your pricing seem more even and consistent if you're using the Currency Amount price method. Refer to the table for information about how different rounding options will affect pricing for items.

| **Calculated price** | **Rounding policy** | **Round option** | **Round amount** | **New price** |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| \$1.26               | None                | Not applicable   | Not applicable   | \$1.26        |
| \$1.26               | Up                  | Multiple of      | \$0.05           | \$1.30        |
| \$1.26               | Up                  | Ends in          | \$0.09           | \$1.29        |
| \$1.26               | Down                | Multiple of      | \$0.05           | \$1.25        |
| \$1.26               | Down                | Ends in          | \$0.09           | \$1.19        |
| \$1.26               | To Nearest          | Multiple of      | \$0.05           | \$1.25        |
| \$1.26               | To Nearest          | Ends in          | \$0.09           | \$1.29        |

### Copying a price list from one item to others

You can copy a price list from one item to others as needed, as long as all items share the same unit of measure schedule. In the preview window, you can adjust the prices for the individual items in the update list. Refer to *Requirements and effects of copying price lists* for more information about copying price lists.

You can end a price list wizard session at any time by choosing Cancel. Your records will be unchanged until you choose Finish in the last price list wizard window.

### Items updated by price list wizards

When you're completing any of the price list wizards, you have the option to select groups of items to change. For example, you can add a price list to several items, or copy a price list from an existing item to several other items.

You can select a large group of items using a restrictions window. Each of the price list wizards includes a restrictions window. The Add Price List Wizard - Restrictions window—shown here—is typical. You can use the window to select groups of items based on item numbers, class IDs, and other attributes. Items that meet all restrictions in the window are included in the list of candidate items to be changed.

![Screenshot of the Add Price List Wizard - Restrictions window.](media/eec7f923650251582aab4763c9fa4b85.jpg)

Depending on the price list wizard you're using, however, the items might also need to meet other criteria before the items can be updated. For example, you can add a price list only to items that have the same price method as the price list you're adding.

Refer to the table for more information about the criteria items must meet to be updated.

| **If you're using this price list wizard...** | **... items must meet these requirements:**                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adding a price list                           | The item has the same price method as selected in the wizard.                      |
| Copying a price list                          | The destination items must have the same unit of measure schedule as the source item|
| Updating a price list                         | The item has the same price method as selected in the wizard.                      |
| Removing a price list                         | The combination of currency, price level, unit of measure, and quantity breaks to be updated already exists in the item's price list. |
| Assigning a currency                          | The currency can't already be assigned to the item.                                |

If you're using Multicurrency Management, the currency must already be assigned to the item.

The unit of measure can't already exist for the currency-price level combination.

The source item price list and destination item must have at least one currency in common.

The combination of currency, price level, unit of measure, and quantity breaks to be updated already exists in the item's price list.

### Chapter 33: Extended pricing utilities

This part of the documentation contains the procedures you need for transferring and removing price sheet information. Always back up your accounting data before performing these procedures.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Transferring price sheet details*

- *Removing price sheets*

### Transferring price sheet details

Use the Price Sheet Transfer window to transfer items from one price sheet to another. You can transfer all items, active items only, or selected items. If an item already exists on the destination price sheet, you can overwrite the existing item or leave it unchanged.

You can transfer customer, prospect, or price book assignments—or all of these— from one price sheet to another. For example, if an existing price sheet is assigned to multiple price books, you can transfer its price book assignments to a new price sheet to automatically assign the new price sheet to the same price books.

To prevent some pricing errors that could occur, there are restrictions on transfers to the base price book.

**Items** If the price sheet details for an item are not net-price details, that information can't be transferred to the base price book. For example, you can't transfer promotional price information to the base price book. This is because the base price book contains only net prices.

**Assignments** Non-net price sheets can't be assigned to the base price book by transferring assignments.

**To transfer price sheet details:**

1. Open the Price Sheet Transfer window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Extended Pricing \>\> Price Sheet Transfer)

![Screenshot of the Price Sheet Transfer window.](media/78e5101f7ea3fe86a11dc54464428ba9.jpg)

2. Enter or select a source price sheet ID.

3. Enter or select a destination price sheet ID. If the price sheet does not already exist, it will be created when you transfer information.

4. If you're using Multicurrency Management and the destination price sheet will be a new price sheet, enter or select the currency for the new price sheet.

If the currency you select is not the same as the currency of the source price sheet, Exchange Rate and Calculation Method fields will appear. If you have set up an exchange table for the currency conversion, that information will be displayed in the fields. You can accept the default values, or change them.

Refer to the Multicurrency Management documentation for more information about exchange rates.

5. Indicate whether to transfer assignment details, item details, or both.

**Transfer Assignment Details** Mark this option to have the destination price sheet assigned to the same customers, prospects, or price books as the source price sheet.

**Transfer Item Details** Mark this option to have price sheet details from the source price sheet transferred to the destination price sheet.

*If the destination price sheet is a new price sheet, you must transfer details for at least one item.*

6. If you marked Transfer Assignment Details, choose what information will be transferred and how it will be transferred.

**Price Sheet Assignments** Mark Copy to leave the assignments of the source price sheet unchanged, or mark Move to remove the assignments of the source price sheet.

**Assignments to Transfer** Mark as many options as you like. Mark Customers to transfer customer assignments, Prospects to transfer prospect assignments, or Price Books to transfer price book assignments.

If you marked Transfer Price Sheet Item Details, choose what information will be transferred and how it will affect the source price sheet.

**Transfer Overwrite Mode** Mark Overwrite Existing Items if the new price sheet information should replace existing price sheet information. Mark New Item Only if information only about items that aren't already on the destination price sheet should be transferred.

**Items to Transfer** Mark All Items to transfer information about all items from the source price list to the destination price list. Mark Active Items to transfer only price sheet lines that are active. Mark Selected Items to transfer only price sheet lines that you specify. Refer to step 8 for information about specifying the lines to transfer.

**Change Transferred Items Active Status to** Mark Unchanged if the status of the transferred lines should be the same on both the source price sheet and the destination price sheet. Mark Active if the status of the transferred lines should be active on the destination price sheet. Mark Inactive if the status of the transferred lines should be inactive on the destination price sheet.

**Transfer Price Sheet Item Details** Mark Transfer Price Sheet Item Details if the pricing details—such as quantity breaks, net prices, value-off amounts, or percentage of list—should be transferred.

*If you select to transfer price sheet details, prices will be converted as necessary during the transfer. You might be required to select an exchange rate.*

7. If you marked the option to transfer item details for selected items, choose the items to transfer.

The items that are assigned to the source price sheet will be displayed in the Items in Source Price Sheet list. To select an item, highlight it in the list and choose Insert to move it to the Selected Items to Transfer list.

8. Choose Transfer to process the price sheet transfer.

The Price Sheet Maintenance window will open, displaying information about the destination price sheet. You can review the information that was transferred, using the Price Sheet Detail Maintenance window to verify and edit details as needed. Refer to *Creating and editing price sheet details* for more information.

### Chapter 35: Reconciling inventory records

Reconciling is a process that recalculates inventory quantities for a range of item numbers so inventory quantities match posted quantities. You might need to reconcile inventory records if one of the following situations occurs:

- Your data has been damaged.

- You've changed the number of decimal places tracked for an item.

- You're preparing to complete year-end closing tasks.

- You're preparing to use multiple bins.

You also might need to reconcile inventory quantities if inventory reports show conflicting quantity information, or if you suspect that quantities might not be in balance. However, you shouldn't have to reconcile inventory quantities unless your data has been damaged, or some other unusual problem has occurred.

The following information is discussed:

- *Effects of reconciling inventory records*

- *Reconciling inventory records*

### Effects of reconciling inventory records

When quantities are reconciled, the quantities recorded for the item will be reset to match purchase receipt and serial number or lot number quantities. Purchase receipts won't be removed during the reconcile procedures. Item quantities for unposted transactions are included in the reconciliation.

The following rules also apply.

**Multiple bins**

If you're using multiple bins, the quantities in the bins can be adjusted to match the quantity for the site. For example, suppose that the receipt quantity of Item A at the Warehouse is 45, the quantity at the Warehouse site is 50, and the total of the bin quantities for the item-site combination is 51. In this case, the site quantity would be adjusted to 45 and the bin quantity would be adjusted by six units.

However, the allocated quantities for bins are not reconciled to the allocated quantities for the site, but to the allocated quantities in unposted transactions. This is because items can be allocated at the site level before they are allocated at the bin level. Generally, items are allocated at the site level at the instant the allocation occurs, but items are allocated at the bin level when the fulfillment of the allocation occurs.

After you mark the option to enable multiple bins, you should reconcile inventory records. Doing so will create a bin for every item-site quantity that hasn't already been assigned to a bin. For more information about what happens when you reconcile inventory after marking the options, refer to *Handling existing quantities for multiple bins*.

**Serial and lot numbers**

If serial numbers or lot numbers are missing, new serial numbers or lot numbers will be added during the reconciliation process. If you don't want to use the numbers that have been added, you can enter decrease transactions to "back out" those changes, and then enter increase transactions for the correct numbers in the Item Transaction Entry window.

*Refer to Entering an adjustment or variance transaction for more information.*

**Purchase order information**

Items entered on drop-ship purchase orders or drop-ship blanket purchase orders are reconciled to the Drop-Ship PO quantity in Inventory Control. The on-order quantities for items on a drop-ship purchase order or a drop-ship blanket purchase order aren't reconciled. The remaining on-order quantity of released and change order purchase order line items and blanket line items are reconciled to the on-order quantity for the all-site of an item and each item-site combination of an item.

Blanket line items are included in the reconcile process. The control line item for blanket purchase orders and drop-ship blanket purchase orders aren't included.

If you're using Purchase Order Processing, reconcile purchasing information using the Reconcile Purchasing Documents window before reconciling inventory quantities. It's important that purchasing documents are correct because purchasing information might be altered and will be used when reconciling quantities for inventoried items.

**Sales order information**

If you're using Sales Order Processing, you also should reconcile that module before reconciling inventory.

### Reconciling inventory records

You can use the Reconcile Inventory Quantities window to reconcile inventory records.

Before reconciling quantities in Inventory Control, back up all your company's accounting data. You should reconcile modules in this order:

- Sales Order Processing

- Purchase Order Processing

- Inventory

**To reconcile inventory records:**

1. Open the Reconcile Inventory Quantities window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Reconcile)

![Screenshot of the Reconcile Inventory Quantities window.](media/d5301f146698d8bec0f69a8b55618bb8.jpg)

2. Enter or select the range of item numbers to reconcile.

3. If you're reconciling inventory because you've changed the number of quantity decimals for an item, mark the Include Item History option so the item's history records also are updated.

4. Choose Process to reconcile inventory quantities.

Actual quantities and the quantities resulting from posted transactions are compared, and adjusted if needed. The Reconcile Report automatically is printed.

### Chapter 36: Inventory Control setup changes

When you define each item, you can specify the number of decimal places that should be tracked for the currency and quantity information of the item, and you select the valuation method to be used to track item costs. Once these selections are made, they aren't often changed. You might need to change them, however, if an error was made during setup. You might want to change
the number of decimal places used to track item quantities if an item's base unit of measure has changed.

The following information is discussed:

- *Changing currency or quantity decimal places for items*

- *Handling effects of changing quantity decimals for items*

- *Effects of changing decimal places for currencies for items*

- *Changing valuation methods*

- *Effects of changing valuation methods*

- *Removing bins*

- *Replacing all buyers or planners*

- *Updating purchase order generator options for several items*

- *Modifying lot number attributes*

### Changing currency or quantity decimal places for items

Use the Change Decimal Places window to change the number of decimal places used for keeping quantity or currency amounts for items. You might need to complete this procedure if an item was set up improperly, or if you're changing the units of measurement for an item.

*If an item is on an unposted transaction, you can't change its decimal place settings.*

**To change currency or quantity decimal places for items:**

1. Open the Change Decimal Places window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Change Decimal Places)

![Screenshot of the Change Decimal Places window.](media/13f72af1e7c333bb0ec3efb271cfe2ed.jpg)

2. To change the number of decimal places used to track quantity information, mark Change Quantity Decimal Places and select the number of quantity decimal places.

When you mark the Change Quantity Decimal Places window, an alert message appears, warning that changing the number of quantity decimal places will  clear the unit of measure schedule, the price list, and the purchasing options for the item. If you choose to continue, you can refer to *Handling effects of changing quantity decimals for items* for more information.

3. To change the number of decimal places used to track currency information, mark Change Currency Decimal Places and select the number of currency decimal places.

When you mark the Change Currency Decimal Places window, an alert message appears, warning that changing the number of currency decimal places will mean that prices are rounded or padded with zeros. If you choose to continue, you can refer to *Effects of changing decimal places for currencies for items* for more information.

4. If you're using Multicurrency Management, specify which currency the change will apply to.

5. Enter or select the range of items you want to change. You can select items by specifying a range of item numbers, descriptions, generic descriptions, and class IDs. You can set as many of the ranges as needed. If you enter more than one range restriction, Microsoft Dynamics GP changes the decimal places only for the items that meet all the selected criteria.

*Changing quantity decimal places changes all instances of that item across all quantities, and the numbers are rounded to the nearest decimal place.*

6. Verify your changes by choosing File \>\> Print to print the Decimal Places Change Audit List.

7. Choose Process to update item records.

8. Reconcile item quantities. Refer to *Reconciling inventory records* for more information.

### Handling effects of changing quantity decimals for items

If you change quantity decimal places for an item, the unit of measure schedule, price list, and purchasing options for the item are cleared. You might need to create a new unit of measure schedule, if a suitable one doesn't already exist. For each of the items with changed quantity decimal place settings, you must assign a unit of measure schedule, create a price list, and set purchasing options. Refer to the table for more information.

| **To do this ...**                           | **...refer to this section:**             |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Create a unit of measure schedule            | *Creating a unit of measure schedule*     |
| Assign a unit of measure schedule to an item | *Creating an item record*                 |
| Create a new price list                      | *Creating a price list for an item*       |
| Set purchasing options                       | *Entering purchasing options for an item* |

### Effects of changing decimal places for currencies for items

If you change the number of decimal places used to keep currency information for an item, the effect of your change will depend on whether you're increasing or decreasing the number of decimal places.

**If you're decreasing the number of decimal places** All receipts are rounded, and all item records, purchase receipts, quantities, vendor information, and kits are updated. Refer to the table for information about how currency amounts are rounded when the number of decimal places is decreased.

| **Original amount** | **Rounded to**     | **Result** |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| .6215               | Two decimal places | .62        |
| .6045               | Two decimal places | .60        |
| .6455               | Two decimal places | .65        |

**If you're increasing the number of decimal places** Zeros are added for all amounts on the purchase receipts. For example, moving from two to three decimal places would change cost information from \$4.57 to \$4.570.

### Changing valuation methods

You also can change the valuation method used for a single item or for a group of items—as long as the item or items aren't on an unposted transaction. Refer to *Valuation methods* for more information.

*You should use the Change Valuation Method window only when you want to correct an item record that was set up with the wrong valuation method. If you want to change valuation methods for other reasons, we recommend that you consult your tax adviser, because changing valuation methods has legal restrictions in some areas.*

If you change the valuation method for an item and then generate the historical stock status report, be aware that reports for dates that precede the change might not be accurate because of how costs are calculated for the report.

**To change valuation methods:**

1. Open the Change Valuation Method window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Change Valuation)

![Screenshot of the Change Valuation Method window.](media/6732e2452f42cdd6eec5754f22c1acad.jpg)

2. Select a new valuation method.

3. Enter or select the range of items you want to change. You can select items by specifying a range of item numbers, descriptions, generic descriptions, and class IDs. You can set as many of the ranges as needed. If you enter more than one range restriction, Microsoft Dynamics GP changes the valuation method only for the items that meet all the selected criteria.

*You can change valuation methods only for those Sales Inventory or Discontinued items that aren't on an unposted transaction.*

4. You can choose File \>\> Print to generate the Valuation Method Change Audit report to verify the ranges before processing the changes.

5. Choose Process to update the selected item records.

The Valuation Methods Change Audit Report is printed for the updated range.

### Effects of changing valuation methods

You should be aware of how changing the valuation method for an item will affect the item record. Refer to the table for more information.

| **Old method**        | **New method**        | **Effect on item information**                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Any                   | Average Perpetual     | The current cost for each item in the range is averaged.                                                                                                                                              |
| Average Perpetual     | Any                   | The current cost is updated to reflect the most recent receipt of the item.                                                                                                                           |

### Removing bins

If you're using multiple bins, you can use the Remove Bins window to remove bins. You can remove them from the item-site combinations they're assigned to, or from the sites entirely. You can remove all bins or a range of bins for all sites or for a range of sites. You also can choose to remove bins from all items or from a range of items.

To be removed, a bin must meet the following requirements:

- The bin can't be included in any pending (unposted) transactions.

- The item quantities of the bin must be zero.

- The bin cannot be the default bin for a site or for an item-site combination.

**To remove bins:**

1. Open the Remove Bins window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Remove Bins)

![Screenshot of the Remove Bins window.](media/1a5bd43e7c32bc7711b8cc3bfb82e00a.jpg)

2. Choose the bins to remove. You can remove all bins or a range of bins.

3. Choose whether to remove the bins entirely, or to remove them (unassign them) from item-site combinations.

4. Choose the sites to remove bins from.

5. If you're removing bins from item-site combinations, choose the items to remove bins from.

6. Choose Process. A progress window will display the progress of the process.

7. When you've finished, close the window.

### Replacing all buyers or planners

If you've assigned buyers or planners to sites or to item-site combinations, then you can use the Replace Resource Planning Buyer/Planner window to change all instances of one buyer with another buyer, or one planner with another.

*This procedure affects only the buyer and planner selections made in the Item Resource Planning Maintenance window and the Resource Planning Site Maintenance window. It doesn't affect any buyer or planner selections that might exist in Purchase Order Processing.*

**To replace all buyers or planners:**

1. Open the Replace Resource Planning Buyer/Planner window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Replace Resource Planning Buyer/Planner)

![Screenshot of the Replace Resource Planning Buyer/Planner window.](media/6ffa62336b0b9d45d0adaa939f9e85f2.jpg)

2. Mark Buyer to change one buyer record for another, or mark Planner if to change one planner record for another.

3. Enter or select the Existing buyer or planner.

4. Enter or select the New buyer or planner.

5. Choose Replace.

If any records couldn't be updated, the Replace Resource Buyer/Planner Exception report will be generated. The report will list all records that couldn't be updated. You can change those using the Item Resource Planning Maintenance window or the Resource Planning Site Maintenance window, or you can repeat the replacement later, when other users are no longer working with the records that need to be changed.

6. Close the window.

### Updating purchase order generator options for several items

You can use the Purchase Order Item Mass Update window to modify how items are set up for the purchase order generator. For example, you could update a range of items to change their order method or replenishment level.

**To update purchase order generator options for several items:**

1. Open the Purchase Order Item Mass Update window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Purchase Order Item Mass Update)

![Screenshot of the Purchase Order Item Mass Update window.](media/310927adcc696800e2295b987ef29276.jpg)

2. Use the Restrictions fields to choose the items that will be updated. You can use as many restrictions as you like.

*If items with the Discontinued item type are included in the group of items you choose, those records will be updated even though no purchase orders will be suggested for those items.*

3. Select a Report Sort Option. After you update the items, a report about the changes will be generated. The sort option determines the order for the information on the report.

4. Choose the values to update. To select a value, mark the Update checkbox, and then enter the information that should be used for that value.

For example, you can mark the Update checkbox for the Order Method value, and then select the order method that the items should have when they're updated.

*Item information won't be updated if the change would cause the item record to be invalid. Refer to Overview of the purchase order generator and How quantities are calculated for suggested purchase orders.*

5. Choose Process. A status window will display information about the records as they're updated. When the changes are complete, a report destination window appears so you can select how the Purchase Order Generator Item Mass Update report is printed.

*The report won't include information for items that have the Not Planned order method, but will include items that have the Discontinued item type.*

### Modifying lot number attributes

You can use the Edit Lot Number Attributes window to modify the lot attributes of a lot number assigned to an item number. There may be five attributes, including as many as three alphanumeric and two date attributes, that are displayed in the window. Attribute labels are assigned in the Lot Category Setup window for the lot category. You also can modify the manufactured date and expiration date.

**To modify lot number attributes:**

1. Open the Edit Lot Number Attributes window.
(Inventory \>\> Utilities \>\> Edit Lot Number Attributes)

![Screenshot of the Edit Lot Number Attributes window.](media/0cca75ad0e85c4868f5dc679a1d520c3.jpg)

2. Enter or select an item number for which lot numbers are tracked.

3. Enter or select the lot number that you want to modify.

4. If lot attributes were assigned to the lot number, you can modify the attributes.

5. You also can enter or modify the expiration date and the manufactured date.

An icon appears in the Expiration Date field if the lot has already expired.

6. Choose Process to update the lot attributes.

## Part 6: Routines

This part of the documentation includes information about Inventory Control routines. Use these routines to perform regularly scheduled tasks, such as closing a year or fiscal period, or to standardize other regularly scheduled maintenance procedures using the checklists.

The following information is discussed:

- *Chapter 37, "ABC analysis,"* describes how you can perform an ABC analysis on inventoried items, so you can adjust your business practices to more closely monitor those items that are most important to your organization.

- *Chapter 38, "Year-end closing,"* includes information about the tasks and procedures you need to complete to close your inventory records for a fiscal period or for a year.

- *Chapter 39, "Inventory control checklists,"* contains information about using Inventory Control Checklists.

### Chapter 37: ABC analysis

ABC analysis is a method of prioritizing items based on parameters that you specify. ABC analysis is based on the Pareto principle, a broad generalization that recognizes "predictable imbalance"—that, for example, 80 percent of the value of your inventory might come from 20 percent of the items. With ABC analysis, you can identify which items are most critical to your business, which are somewhat critical and which are least important. Then you can manage those items accordingly.

Inventory Control includes a wizard you can use to complete ABC analysis of Sales Inventory and Discontinued items. Most of the information you need to use a wizard is built into the windows, but you can refer to this information as needed.

The following information is discussed:

- *ABC analysis overview*

- *Requirements for ABC analysis*

- *Performing ABC analysis of inventoried items*

- *ABC analysis ranking value calculations*

- *ABC analysis and large inventories*

- *Previewing and adjusting ABC analysis results*

- *Finalizing ABC analysis results*

- *ABC analysis and zero or negative item quantities*

- *Modifying an item's ABC code*

- *Using ABC analysis information*

### ABC analysis overview

You can sort items into A, B, and C classifications. "A" items are the most important items in your inventory. They should be tightly controlled, with accurate records. "B" items might be less controlled, with good records, and "C" items might have minimal records with periodic review. If the on-hand quantities and usage of some items is zero or negative, an ABC code doesn't need to be assigned to them.

ABC analysis helps you group the type of information that the ABC analysis of items will be based on. You can group items using the following options in the ABC Analysis Options window.

- Usage quantity (the number of units consumed over a period of time)

- Usage value (usage quantity times unit cost)

- On-hand inventory value (on-hand quantity in the Items Quantity Maintenance window times unit cost)

- Unit cost (the current cost or standard cost depending on the valuation method of each item)

You can base the classifications on historical or projected numbers—or a combination of both. Refer to *Using ABC analysis information* for more information about how you can use ABC classifications.

### Requirements for ABC analysis

Before beginning an ABC analysis, be sure that no one is performing any of these activities:

- Using any Inventory Control utility, such as a price list wizard or removing history records

- Completing year-end closing procedures

- Starting a separate ABC analysis

### Performing ABC analysis of inventoried items

Use the ABC Analysis wizard to analyze your item usage and prioritize items, helping you to manage inventory more effectively. We recommend that you perform this procedure at least once a year.

*You might want to use the process server to make the ABC calculations and updates a remote process. Refer to ABC analysis and large inventories for more information.*

**To perform ABC analysis of inventoried items:**

1. Open the ABC analysis wizard, then choose Next.
(Inventory \>\> Routines \>\> Item ABC Analysis)

2. In the ABC Analysis Options window, select the type of information you want the analysis to be based on. Choose Next.

![Screenshot of the ABC Analysis Options window.](media/4aa49215b83ee48b3a5faa967614ee0d.jpg)

*Refer to ABC analysis ranking value calculations for information about how these options affect ABC analysis calculations.*

3. In the ABC System Options window, determine if items with zero on-hand quantities and zero usage should be assigned no ABC code. To have items with negative on-hand and usage quantities treated as if they had zero on-hand quantities, mark the second option.

*Refer to ABC analysis and zero or negative item quantities for more information.*

![Screenshot of the ABC System Options window.](media/dc9e612576bf5243d5661fa586fe2bbe.jpg)

Choose Next.

**If your analysis is based on on-hand inventory value or unit cost** Skip to step 7. The on-hand inventory value and unit cost methods assume that calculations will be based on historical annual usage for calendar years.

**If your ABC analysis is based on usage value or quantity** The ABC Calendar Option window opens. Continue with the next step.

4. In the ABC Calendar Options window, select the periods to be used to calculate ABC information. You can choose Fiscal Periods or Calendar Months. Choose Next.

![Screenshot of the ABC Calendar Options window.](media/54d05bda2ba2ced317a796f8b050f0b2.jpg)

5. In the ABC Usage Quantity window, select how you want to control the calculation based on usage quantity or usage value. You can choose to use historical or projected numbers, or a combination of both.

If you select Weighted Average, enter the weighting percentage for historical and projected usage. Choose Next.

![Screenshot of the ABC Usage Quantity window.](media/85f4a1272ea87cffcb50d93b82262608.jpg)

6. In the ABC Breakpoints window, specify if percentages, currency amounts, or quantities will be used to define breakpoints for the analysis. (Options depend on the type of analysis option you selected earlier.)

![Screenshot of the ABC Breakpoints window.](media/d0e94b1421e0d29602b3a89a0620df1f.jpg)

A breakpoint is the boundary between two adjacent ABC classifications—for example, if you want A items to be those that reflect 80 percent of inventory value, 80 percent would be the breakpoint. Enter the percentages or amounts for the A and B breakpoints.

*If you're using percentages to define breakpoints, be sure to enter the percentage of inventory value. For example, if you want your A items to be those that make up 75 percent of your inventory valuation, you'd enter 75 as the A Breakpoint.*

7. Decide if you want to preview the results of the analysis before having item records updated with new ABC codes.

**To preview suggested ABC codes** Refer to *Previewing and adjusting ABC analysis results* for more information.

*If you have a large number of item records, opening the Preview window might take some time.*

**To finalize item records without previewing** Refer to *Finalizing ABC analysis results* for more information.

### ABC analysis ranking value calculations

ABC analysis ranks items depending on the options you selected for the analysis.

Dependent demand is demand for component items in bills of materials. For example, suppose you assemble Item ABC, which is built with two widgets and a base. If you entered projected demand for item ABC, the system would calculate the dependent demand for the widgets and bases, based on the bill of materials.

*Use the Item History window to enter projections for items. Refer to Entering item projections for more information.*

Refer to the following table for more information.

| **Analysis option**     | **Usage option** | **Calculation used**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### ABC analysis and large inventories

If you have many inventoried items—10,000 or more—calculating ABC analysis information can take several minutes. If you're using a process server, you might want to consider using it to make the analysis process a remote process—one that will allow you to continue working with your computer while the analysis is being completed.

*If you're using a process server, go to Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System \>\> Process Server, and be sure to mark the option for Inventory: Item ABC Analysis. Refer to the process server documentation for more information about using process server functions.*

### Previewing and adjusting ABC analysis results

Use the ABC Analysis Preview window to preview analysis results, and to make changes, if needed.

*If you have a large number of item numbers, opening the Preview window might take several minutes.*

**To preview and adjust ABC analysis results:**

1. Complete ABC analysis as described in *Performing ABC analysis of inventoried items*. The ABC Analysis Breakpoints window should be open.

2. Choose Preview to open the ABC Analysis Preview window.

![Screenshot of the ABC Analysis Preview window.](media/2475643412f60eb791f434a9222e44ff.jpg)

3. Review information in the scrolling window, making changes as needed.

**To change the ABC code for an item** Select a different classification in the appropriate scrolling window line.

**To remove an item so it isn't updated** Clear the Include option in the appropriate scrolling window line.

4. You can choose File \>\> Print to generate the Item ABC Analysis Preview report. The report includes information about the effects of changes.

5. When you've finished adjusting the ABC classifications, select a sorting order for the final report.

6. Choose OK to save your changes. You'll be returned to the ABC Analysis Breakpoints window.

7. Refer to *Finalizing ABC analysis results* to update item records with the new ABC codes and to generate the Item ABC Analysis Breakpoints Report.

### Finalizing ABC analysis results

Use the ABC Print Options window when you're ready to complete your ABC analysis. Finalizing the ABC analysis results updates item records with new ABC codes, and generates the Item ABC Analysis Results Report.

**To finalize ABC analysis results:**

1. Complete ABC analysis as described in *Performing ABC analysis of inventoried items*. The ABC Analysis Breakpoints window should be open. Choose Next.

2. In the ABC Print Options window, select a sorting order for the Item ABC Analysis Results Report. Choose Next.

![Screenshot of the ABC Print Options window.](media/2fc3e322d8eeb2e24bbd9ce8231eb621.jpg)

3. In the ABC Analysis Summary window, review information about the results of the ABC analysis.

![Screenshot of the ABC Analysis Summary window.](media/9c050363fab746d3f3fec67a2a75e5a6.jpg)

4. To update item records and generate the Item ABC Analysis Results Report, choose Finish.

When the analysis is complete, the Item ABC Analysis Results Report is printed. You can use this report view the analysis results and to ensure that items were prioritized correctly.

*The report can't be reprinted.*

### ABC analysis and zero or negative item quantities

If you have items with zero or negative on-hand quantities and usage, you can use options in the ABC wizard so those items aren't assigned an ABC code. This can be helpful because you might use ABC codes to establish business practices such as the frequency of cycle counts. If an item has no usage—or negative usage—it might be better to omit it from your cycle-count plans entirely.

*Refer to Chapter 18, "Count intervals," for more information.*

If you don't use these options, however, the items with zero or negative on-hand quantities are included in the analysis. This can lead to unexpected results when you preview the analysis results or review the Item ABC Analysis Results Report, because then cumulative percentages are based on rankings for all items—even items with negative usage or on-hand quantities.

To avoid this, mark both options in the ABC System Options window.

### Modifying an item's ABC code

Use the Item Maintenance Options window to verify or modify the ABC code assigned to a specific item.

**To modify an item's ABC code:**

1. Open the Item Maintenance window.

(Inventory \>\> Cards \>\> Item)

2. Enter or select an item number.

3. Choose Options to open the Item Maintenance Options window.

![Screenshot of the Item Maintenance Options window.](media/dec38551e80b0bcf9c81bb395a7b35c4.jpg)

4. Select an ABC code for the item.

5. Choose OK to return to the Item Maintenance window.

6. Choose Save and close the window.

### Using ABC analysis information

The value of completing an ABC analysis is more than just the report that's generated when the results are finalized. You'll get the most use from completing the analysis if you use the ABC codes in your business practices.

For example, you might want to set up cycle counts to monitor the accuracy of inventory records. You can set up different frequencies for counting different items. You might set up one cycle for counting items every 30 days, another for counting items every 60 days, and so on. If you've completed the ABC analysis procedure, you can easily assign all "A" items to the 30-day cycle count, and all "B" items to the 60-day cycle count. You might set up a 120-day cycle count for "C" items—or you might not count them at all.

### Chapter 38: Year-end closing

When you close inventory records for a calendar or fiscal year, all Inventory Control records for the current year are moved to history. Year-end procedures also might include other tasks, such as updating standard costs or removing items that are no longer purchased or sold.

The following information is discussed:

- *Closing a fiscal period*

- *Preparing to close a year*

- *Closing a year*

- *Effects of closing a year*

- *Removal of discontinued items*

### Closing a fiscal period

Closing fiscal periods prevents transactions from being posted inadvertently to the wrong period or year. Some companies also might complete a physical inventory before closing a period.

Before closing a fiscal period, be sure you've posted all the transactions for the period. To post transactions to a fiscal period you've already closed, you must reopen the period before the transaction can be posted.

**To close a fiscal period:**

1. Open the Fiscal Periods Setup window.

(Administration \>\> Setup \>\> Company \>\> Fiscal Periods)

![Screenshot of the Fiscal Periods Setup window.](media/9775c248000580588e21978103e1652a.jpg)

2. Mark the option in the Inventory column for each period you want to close.

3. Choose OK to save your changes.

### Preparing to close a year

Before you can close the Inventory Control module for the year, you must complete several preliminary tasks.

**To prepare to close a year:**

1. Enter and post all transactions for Sales Order Processing, Invoicing, Purchase Order Processing, Inventory Control, and Bill of Materials.

You must complete this step to ensure that historical information is accurate and that year-to-date amounts are updated correctly.

*You can enter transactions for a new year before closing the previous year by entering them in separate batches, however, you should not post these batches until you've closed the year. Refer to other module documentation for information about entering and posting transactions in those modules. Refer to Chapter 21, "Transaction entry," and Chapter 24, "Posting," for more information about completing these tasks for Inventory Control.*

2. If you need to enter future-period transactions before closing a year, create a new batch for those transactions.

3. Reconcile inventory quantities. Refer to *Reconciling inventory records*.

4. Print the Physical Inventory Checklist. Choose Inventory \>\> Reports \>\> Activity to open the Inventory Activity Reports window. Refer to your System User's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Using The System) for more information about printing reports.

5. If needed, complete a stock count, then enter and post any adjustments. Refer to *Chapter 23, "Stock count processing,"* for more information.

6. Print the following reports for your permanent records. Refer to the table for information about navigating to the reports.

Refer to your System User's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Using The System) for more information about printing reports.

7. Make a complete backup of your company data, following your company's backup procedures.

Once you've completed these preliminary steps, you're ready to close the year. Refer to *Closing a year*.

### Closing a year

Closing a year transfers all summarized current-year quantity, cost, and sales amounts to transaction history for the items that have summarized sales history. When you close a year, you also have the options to remove certain records and update standard costs.

*Before continuing, be sure you've completed the tasks described in Preparing to close a year.*

**To close a year:**

1. Open the Inventory Year-end Closing window.
(Inventory \>\> Routines \>\> Year-End Close)

![Screenshot of the Inventory Year-end Closing window.](media/93643a0bc651667e8e6d3f0c5641eb01.jpg)

2. Choose records to remove. You can remove records for discontinued items, sold lot attributes, and sold receipts and historical cost changes, as needed.

*Discontinued items aren't removed if they are assigned to kits, if they are components of bills of materials, or if they have bills of materials of their own. Refer to Removal of discontinued items for more information.*

Sold lot attributes is the information that you might have kept for items tracked by lot numbers—for example, if you track the expiration dates for items tracked by lots. In this case, deleting the sold lot attributes would remove the information about the expiration dates of the sold items.

Sold receipts are records of items that have been both received and then sold. Cost change information is saved to history when the standard cost is changed for a LIFO periodic item or a FIFO periodic item, or when the current cost is changed for an average perpetual item.

3. To update the standard cost information for items with FIFO Periodic or LIFO Periodic valuation methods, mark Item's Standard Cost.

The updated standard cost of each item automatically is adjusted to the current cost, or the amount you most recently paid for the item.

4. Choose Process to close the year.

While the year-end closing is in process, you won't be able to post transactions or batches, reconcile quantities, change valuation methods, or change decimal places. If you attempt to begin one of these procedures, an alert message will appear, warning you that you must wait until the year-end closing process has been completed.

*After you've closed the year, you can close fiscal periods for inventory, if you like. Refer to Closing a fiscal period.*

5. After you've closed the year, you should make a final backup of your company data.

### Effects of closing a year

Processing that occurs when you close a year will complete these tasks:

- All summarized current-year quantities, costs, and sales information of items you've been keeping summarized sales history are transferred to transaction history.

- The Beginning Quantity of each item is updated to be the On Hand quantity at each site. (Some reports—such as the Turnover Report—use the beginning quantity field in calculations.)

- The Quantity Sold field for each item is reset to zero.

The following tasks might be accomplished, depending on the options you select when you begin processing:

- Purchase receipts of items that have been completely sold are removed.

- Cost change history information is removed.

- Discontinued items that have been completely sold are removed.

- Lot attributes of items that are tracked by lot numbers and that have been completely sold are removed.

- The standard cost of each item is updated to the current cost for items using FIFO Periodic or LIFO Periodic valuation methods.

### Removal of discontinued items

When you close a year, you have the option to remove discontinued items—that is, items that have the Discontinued item type. If the item is assigned to a kit, is a component of a bill of materials, or has a bill of materials of its own, it won't be removed.

**Assigned to a kit** Print the Component Report from the Inventory Item Reports window to see if the item is assigned to a kit. Refer to your System User's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Using The System) for more information about printing reports. Refer to *Assigning kit components* for information about removing component items from a kit.

**Component of a bill of materials** Print the BM Component Where-Used  Report from the Inventory Setup Reports window to see if the item is a component of a bill of materials. Refer to the Microsoft Dynamics GP Bill of Materials documentation for information about removing a component from a bill of materials.

**Has a bill of materials** Print the BM Bill of Materials Report from the Inventory Setup Reports window to see if the discontinued item has bills of materials of its own. Refer to the Microsoft Dynamics GP Bill of Materials documentation for information about deleting bills of materials.

*If the item is a component of a bill of materials or has its own bill of materials, be sure to consider all bills of materials. A single finished item can have multiple bills of materials. Also, an item can be a component of bills of materials for several items.*

### Chapter 39: Inventory control checklists

Use Inventory Control checklists to ensure that your business practices are being consistently completed. When checklists are used, the date and time when a specific task was done are recorded, along with the user ID of the person who completed the task.

Inventory Control includes basic checklists, but you can tailor them to the needs of your business. You also can create your own checklists for tasks that are specific to your business.

*Refer to your System Administrator's Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select System Administration) for more information about customizing checklists.*

The following information is discussed:

- *Standard Inventory Control checklists*

- *Using an Inventory Control checklist*

### Standard Inventory Control checklists

Inventory Control includes a checklist for year-end closing and you also can create your own customized checklists. For example, you could create a user-defined checklist for creating and starting a stock count schedule, and then for entering the results of the stock count and posting variance transactions, if needed.

### Using an Inventory Control checklist

Use the Inventory Checklists window to open specific Inventory Control checklists.

**To use an Inventory Control checklist:**

1. Open the Inventory Checklists window.
(Inventory \>\> Routines \>\> Checklists)

![Screenshot of the Inventory Checklists window.](media/d39b0148f63f0b59398dfb0ad2328917.jpg)

2. Select the Frequency of the routine to use.

3. In the Routine scrolling window, highlight the procedure you want to complete.

4. Choose Open to begin performing the selected routine.

Depending on the routine you've selected, choosing Open will open a window or start a macro in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system, or start an external application.


## Part 6: How to determine, maintain, and report accurate costing in Inventory 

This section has been provided to address questions about the calculation and maintenance of Inventory item costs and how those changes affect your inventory valuation. 

With Microsoft Dynamics GP there are several costing enhancements in Inventory module that provide or capture information in the Inventory module that improve the ability to maintain accurate costs when you increase or you decrease inventory quantities. 

The enhancements added business logic that automatically determines, at the time of posting, when a cost variance is encountered in inventory. This business logic handles any currency variance amounts based on the individual item setup or inventory posting setup and cost adjustments are automatically created in the General Ledger module in a summary manner, by default, to the correct accounts. Although some of this logic did exist, the automatic posting of these cost adjustments to the General Ledger module is a significant. 

The following list describes the types of transactions. These five types can cause an inventory revaluation to occur for perpetual items: 
 
1.	Post a purchasing invoice that has been matched to a receipt at a different cost with some of the items from the receipt already being sold.  This scenario will cause a revaluation to occur against the items that were sold prior to matching the invoice if the item is marked to revalue. 
 
2.	Post a purchasing invoice for a Landed Cost amount on a Purchase Receipt Inventory layer that has quantities that have already been sold. This scenario will cause a revaluation to occur for those items that have been sold if the item is marked to revalue. 
 
3.	Close a Purchase Order line short with a shipment quantity greater than the invoiced quantity. When some of these items are sold, this scenario will also cause a revaluation to occur for the sold items. 
 
4.	Use the Adjust Cost Utility and manually adjust the unit cost for a layer. This scenario will cause a revaluation to occur if quantity has been sold on that layer. 
 
5.	Post a transaction that relieves an override purchase receipts layer that resulted in a negative Inventory balance at the Inventory site. 
This scenario will **always** cause a revaluation to occur for the negative quantities.  

**Note: Inventory overrides should be kept at a minimum and should be the exception to usual processing. 
In addition, the following list displays three more transaction types when you use average perpetual as the valuation method: 
 
6.	Post back-dated transactions (either increases or decreases) that affect the quantity on hand as of a specific date and also have inventory sold after the back-dated transaction. This scenario may cause those previously sold items to revalue if the average cost changes based on the backdated transaction. 
 
7.	Post any batch that contains an assortment of increases and decreases to inventory quantities spanning multiple document dates where the document numbers do not coincide with the document dates.   This can occur because the documents in the batch post in order by the Document Number and not the Document Date. 
  
8.	Post a Purchase Order return transaction for subsequent receipts that have been sold and it may cause a revaluation to occur.  
Whenever these costing scenarios occur and a cost adjustment is identified, we calculate a new cost, update the outflow record in the Inventory Purchase Receipt Detail (IV10201) table, and then push this data to the general ledger. We call this process the Inventory Ripple primarily because of what occurs when a revaluation is encountered on an item that uses an Average Valuation method.   
 
The Inventory Ripple has been designed to work with perpetual valuation methods as stated above. But the most prevalent and profound effect is when an item uses Average Perpetual as the valuation method. The calculation or re-calculation of the Average Cost is not only updated with new inflow transactions, but now also outflow transactions such as Inventory decrease adjustments or posting sales invoice transactions can cause an Inventory Ripple.  These changes are driven by our costing enhancements to calculate or maintain an Average Cost on each layer record in the Inventory Purchase Receipt (IV10200) table. This fundamental change allows us to continuously watch and update the average cost whenever Inventory quantity changes back in time essentially making Inventory date sensitive. For example, the following sets of tables demonstrate how an inflow and outflow transaction can change the Average Cost and essentially trigger an Inventory Ripple to occur and force cost adjustments down to the general ledger. This example assumes the item is using 2 decimal places for currency. You can follow this example by entering your own transactions as Inventory adjustments. 


![Chart showing details of Example IV10200. ](media/INVIV10200.JPG)

In the Inventory Purchase Receipt (IV10200) table, three new columns have been added (VCTNMTHD, QTYONHND and ADJUNITCOST). The Qty On Hand (QTYONHND) column and the Average Cost column (ADJUNITCOST) are displayed in the table above. The valuation method (VCTNMTHD) column (not displayed above) is used to determine how the costs are calculated and tracked in the IV10200. The addition of these columns enables us to calculate an Average Cost on each layer.  The Qty On Hand column represents the TOTAL quantity on hand at the time the receipt layer was created and also adjusts whenever quantity is sold based on the transaction date.  In the table above, on March 10th, we processed a transaction quantity of 68 and the Qty On Hand column moved to 118.  Subsequently, the Average Cost column also changed to $1.46.  

The formula used to calculate this new cost is: 
 
![Formula used for calculating Average Cost and an example.](media/INVFORMULA.JPG)

The Qty On Hand column also decreases whenever quantity is sold or adjusted.  However, it decreases based on the Document Date of the transaction that decreases the inventory.  At the time of posting, we look for and find the closest receipt record that is BEFORE or EQUAL to the Document Date of the transaction. For example, if you post a sales invoice with a Document Date of March 12th with a quantity of 25, the March 10th layer would be used and the Qty On Hand field for that layer would have a value of 93 = (118 – 25).  In addition, because the Qty On Hand field is a running or real time quantity field, the receipt layers after March 10th would also be reduced by a quantity of 25. So the March 15th layer of 133 would update to 108, the March 20th layer of 983 would change to 958, and the March 26th layer of 3583 would change to 3558.  After the Inventory Ripple process is finished, the quantity of 3558 should be the TOTAL quantity you have On Hand for the item for all sites. 
 
The key here is that because the quantity On Hand changed for each layer, the Average Cost may also need to be updated; hence, we now start the Inventory Ripple starting at the 10 March receipt moving from layer to layer until we get to the last receipt layer for the item. When finished, the current cost in the Item Maintenance window will be updated to match the Average Cost of the last layer (ordered by the DATERECD, RCTSEQNM column), which would be $.95.  The new table below reflects the change after the sale of 25 is posted on March 12th. 

![Chart showing changes to the values in Example IV10200.](media/INVIV102002.JPG)

 
This is a very simple example of how back-dated outflow transaction can have an impact on the Average Cost calculation because we are now holding and calculating that cost for each inflow layer.  In addition, this example also demonstrates how cost adjustments can occur on some layers and not others and NOT have the current cost on the item card updated. 
 
Another enhancement of our costing changes is that because we have an Average Cost calculated for each receipt layer, we no longer get the cost from the item card when we post a transaction that decreases inventory.  We now determine the cost of the item at the time of posting and get the cost value from the Inventory Purchase receipt (IV10200) table based on the Document Date of the outflow transaction.  For example, for the sale of 25 that occurred on March 12th, the cost used for that transaction was $1.46 even though the item card has a current cost of $.95 (or the calculated Average Cost for the last receipt layer). 
 
To take this one step farther, if the March 15th or 20th layers had any quantity consumed from them, the costing enhancements would have detected that state and a cost adjustment would be in order.  For example, if we had posted a sales invoice dated March 18th for a quantity of 75, before the March 12th sales, the cost at the time of that sale would have been $1.48. Because we have now posted a sales invoice dated March 12th and caused an Inventory Ripple to occur, the outflow quantity of 75 needs to have a cost adjustment.  

The calculation is as follows: 

March 18th:   	 	Qty: 75  	Avg Cost: $1.48  	Extended Cost: $111.00 
Inventory Ripple: 	Qty: 75  	Avg Cost: $1.49  	Extended Cost: $111.75 
 
Because the Average Cost for that layer went up one penny, we have a $.75 difference that needs to be booked to the general ledger.  The $.75 difference will be automatically created as a journal transaction and posted to the General Ledger.  Because the outflow transaction that was revalued was a sales invoice, the following accounts would be updated. 
  
Debit 	        Credit
Cost of Goods   $0.75 
Inventory        $0.75 
 
These accounts are taken from the default posting accounts on the posted transaction line items so it is imperative that the Inventory and Sales distributions are set up correctly.  For example, for each item, you should be using separate accounts for: 
 
Purchase Price Variance 
Cost of Goods 
Inventory 
Inventory Variance 
Inventory Offset  
 
In the event there were multiple outflow transactions that were revalued, the default action is to create a single journal entry that is summarized by account number. Because these accounts are summarized, if you were to use the same account number for each account type on the item, the potential exist that a “wash out” may occur and end up with a $0.00 journal entry. Also, because these entries that have been summarized, it is impossible to identify, reconcile, and determine where they came from. 

The field mapping for the additional data is as follows:

**GL20000 table:** 
Field:  ORCTRNUM: Contains the originating document number of the outflow transaction such as the SOP number or the Inventory document number 
Field: ORMSTRID:  This field will contains the item number that was re-valued on the outflow transaction Field: ORDOCNUM: contains the receipt number from the Inventory                         Purchase Receipt (IV10200) table that had a revaluation and forced the cost adjustment 
Field: ORMSTRNM:  Contains the text string “IV Ripple Transaction” to make it easier to identify the cost adjustments flowing into the general ledger. 
 
**Inventory Reporting**
Currently, there are two reports within Microsoft Dynamics GP that can provide a snapshot of either current or historical quantity information and also costing information.  Those reports are: 
•	Stock Status Report 
•	Historical Stock Status Report 

The Stock Status report is intended to provide a current snapshot of the inventory currently on hand and the current cost for each item.  The report then aggregates the quantity and costs (Quantity * Current Cost) for each item to provide an inventory value amount and then summarizes the value for all items for an overall picture of what the inventory value truly is at that moment.  

The expectations for this report to balance to the general ledger are as follows: 

FIFO/LIFO Perpetual Items – This should balance to the general ledger 
Average Perpetual and Periodic – It is expected that these items will not balance to the general ledger 
 
The reason average perpetual and periodic items do not balance to the general ledger is because these valuation methods do not use actual costs when you are processing outflow transactions. They use either a current average cost or a standard cost and because of rounding and other issues, it is highly likely that costs posted for items using these valuation methods will not balance to the general ledger. The Historical Stock Status report was designed to provide an inventory snapshot (picture) AS OF a specific historical date.  An example would be determining what was on hand for a specific item last month or last fiscal quarter and what the inventory cost was associated with that quantity. This report uses the transactional data that is contained within the inventory history tables (IV30300 and IV30301) which contain the actual costs that were used for all inflow and outflow transactions. This report also has the ability to print in detail or in summary for the given item. 
 
What makes this Historical Stock Status report unique is that it runs backward. It starts with the current quantity and cost for a given item and then aggregates through the detail historical transactions starting with the most recent transactions and then moving back in time to the specified date. The Historical Stock Status report does not and will not run forward exactly like the Payables Management Historical Aged Trial Balance report or the Receivables Management Historical Aged Trial Balance report. Because of the way this report calculates its data, there are challenges and assumptions made to determine what costs are used and printed on this report when it deals with items that use an average perpetual or periodic valuation method. 
 
When using an Average Perpetual or Periodic valuation method for your inventory, there is an option on the report options window that the end-user must choose on how they want to determine their cost of the inventory.  

Those choices are as follows: 
•	Historical Cost 
•	Today’s Standard/Average Cost 

The option you choose is a determining factor about what costs will be used to determine the total extended cost for the item. 
 
The Today’s Standard/Average Cost option uses the current cost from the item card to determine what the extended cost starting amount will be. Any time the cost changes in the Item Maintenance window, that change is tracked and stored in the IV00118 table. When the historical cost option is selected, we look to this table to determine whether we have a cost that fits the report requirements. We use the cost associated with the date that is equal to or before the As of Date on the report. If no record exists in the IV00118 table, then we use the Current Cost in the Item Maintenance window. Another note is that the IV00118 uses the Microsoft Dynamics GP user date instead of a document date or posting date to fill the date fields in this table. Therefore, it is critical that the user date matches the current date when you post transactions that affect inventory. 
 
The challenge or assumption when using these valuation methods is that this report uses the same logic as the Stock Status report for its beginning quantity and cost (Today’s or Historical).  We have already stated above that the expectation is that the Stock Status report will not balance or tie out to the general ledger and because we use the same logic as the starting point and then process backwards, the same assumption for the Historical Stock Status holds true.  This report will not balance or tie out to the general ledger and should not be used as a reconciliation tool or used to adjust the general ledger inventory account balances based on the results of the report. 
 
The focal point of this issue is around the following question:  What is the correct method of determining inventory value?  Is the correct method to always use the (quantity * current cost), which will not balance to the general ledger with some valuation methods. Or is the correct method to always aggregate through the history transactions to determine the value when it should balance to the general ledger?  These questions can spur a significant amount of debate or confusion on which method is correct. The key concept to keep in mind when discussing or pondering these questions is this; if the entire inventory was sold today, what would be the impact on the general ledger?  For FIFO/LIFO perpetual valuation methods, the general ledger should have a $0.00 balance. But for the other valuation methods, some differences would exist.   
 
For example, if the valuation methods being used were Average Perpetual/Periodic and a historical report was run with an AS OF DATE for March 1st that aggregates through the detail historical inventory transactions, will the Stock Status report get the same numbers if the report was run on March 1st? The answer would be NO. This is because the historical report uses the actual costs to determine value and the Stock Status report uses the current cost to determine its value. 
Additionally, if you make manual adjustments to the general ledger and those adjustments are not present within inventory history, complications occur with the ability to have an inventory historical report that balances to the general ledger 
 
In conclusion, we recommend that customers do not use the Inventory Historical Stock Status report to adjust or balance to the general ledger.  The report was not designed for that purpose. While FIFO/LIFO perpetual inventories may be very close in balancing, there are issues still pending that would keep this report from balancing to the general ledger.  The recommendation is that on a daily basis, the Stock Status report is processed at the end of the day once all general ledger batches that affect inventory have been posted.  This report would be the most accurate report there is to date in determining your inventory value. 
 
Additional reporting solution called the Historical Inventory Trial Balance (HITB) report gives the ability to better maintain and track the costs used within inventory in conjunction with the data moving to the general ledger. 

        
## Glossary

#### ABC analysis

A review of inventory records that helps you to classify your inventoried items according to their importance to your business.

#### ABC code

The code assigned to each item—A, B, or C— that denotes the importance of that item in your business. ABC codes can be assigned though use of the ABC Analysis wizard, or on an item-by-item basis. ABC codes should be used to help you determine the amount of monitoring each item requires: you should monitor A items most closely, B items less closely, and C items least closely.

A portion of the account format that can be used to represent a specific aspect of a business. For example, accounts can be divided into segments that represent business locations, divisions, or profit centers.

#### Account segment number

A number that represents a particular area of a business or an account category. For example, if you have account 01-200-1100, the account segment 01 might represent a particular site, 200 might represent a department located at that site, and 1100 might represent the Cash account for that site and that department. You can enter descriptions for each account segment number; these descriptions then appear on General Ledger reports.

#### Accounting

The process of recording, classifying, reporting, and interpreting financial information for a company or a business.

#### Adjusting entry

Transactions that increase or decrease inventory quantities. For example, variance transactions entered after a physical count are adjusting entries.

#### Audit trail code

A series of alphanumeric characters providing a precise record of each transaction and where it has been posted within Microsoft Dynamics GP.

#### Average cost

The cost assigned to an item. The average cost is a weighted average that is updated each time an item is received. Average cost is calculated based on the base unit of measure.

#### Average perpetual

An inventory valuation method in which the cost of all items with the same item number is added and then divided by the total number of items with that item number. Items using this valuation method are revalued each time they are entered on an increase adjustment.

#### Back orders

## Inventory Troubleshooting

### How to manually correct a failed In-transit document in GP

If you are unable to complete an In-transit PO receipt, follow the steps below to manually correct it. This will give you the ability to move items that are stuck at your Via site to your final To site through a manual inventory transfer.

Note: This will remove the in-transit document from GP, no further transactions can be entered against it. If you do not want to lose history for your in-transit document, do not follow these steps.

Try these steps in a test system prior to running them in your live database. Before running any scripts, back-up of your database is recommended.

1. Verify there is not a current unposted In-transit PO receipt.

   Check the POP10300 to see if there is an unposted shipment receipt.

   SELECT * from POP10300 where POPRCTNM in (SELECT POPRCTNM from POP10500 where PONUMBER = 'Enter your in-transit doc number')

   - If there are no results from this script, go to the Clean Up section.
   - If there is an unposted in-transit PO receipt, either delete it from within GP or post it.
   - If you are using SQL to delete it, delete the records out of POP10500, POP10300, and POP10310.
   - If you delete it, try to enter a new in-transit receipt.
   - If you are unable to create a new POP in-transit receipt, go to the Clean Up section.

2. Complete all items that you can complete in the In- transit document before going to the Clean Up Section.

3. Clean Up Section

   Steps to clean up the in-transit tables so that you can do a normal inventory transfer to transfer the items from the in-transit Via site to the To site.

   1. Run the below scripts to ‘clean’ up the Inventory tables:

      update IV10200 set RCPTSOLD='0', QTYRESERVED='0' where RCPTNMBR='Enter your intransit number'

      update IV00300 set LTNUMSLD='0', ATYALLOC='0' from IV10200 b, IV00300 a where a. ITEMNMBR=b.ITEMNMBR and a. RCTSEQNM=b.RCTSEQNM and b. RCPTNMBR='Enter your intransit number'

      update IV00200 set SERLNSLD ='0' from IV10200 b, IV00200 a where a. ITEMNMBR=b.ITEMNMBR and a. RCTSEQNM=b.RCTSEQNM and b. RCPTNMBR='Enter your intransit number'

      Delete SVC00700 where ORDDOCID='enter your in-transit document number'

      Delete SVC00701 where ORDDOCID='enter your in-transit document number'

      Delete SVC00702 where ORDDOCID='enter your in-transit document number'

   2. Run an Inventory Reconcile to update the allocated quantities. Do not skip this step.

   3. You should now be able to transfer any quantities from the Via site to the To site that have not already been transferred. 

      To determine the remaining quantity that can be transferred run the below script.

      select ITEMNMBR, RCTSEQNM, QTYRECVD, QTYSOLD, qtyrecvd-qtysold as 'Remaining Quantity', QTYRESERVED from IV10200 where RCPTNMBR='enter your in-transit document number'

      Remaining Lot quantities:

      SELECT  a.ITEMNMBR , a.locncode as 'IV00300 VIA SITE', a.LOTNUMBR, a. QTYRECVD, a. QTYSOLD, a.QTYRECVD-a.qtysold as 'REMAINING', a. ATYALLOC, a.RCTSEQNM, a. LTNUMSLD from IV10200 b, IV00300 a where a. ITEMNMBR=b.ITEMNMBR and a. RCTSEQNM=b.RCTSEQNM and b. RCPTNMBR='enter your in-transit document number'

      Remaining Serial numbers:

      Remaining Serial quantities:

      Select count (serlnmbr)  from IV10200 b, IV00200 a where a. ITEMNMBR=b.ITEMNMBR and a. RCTSEQNM=b.RCTSEQNM and b. RCPTNMBR='enter your in-transit document number'

      The amount remaining in the IV10200 should match the amount remaining in the IV00200 if the item is a serial number or the IV00300 if the item is a lot tracked item.

   4. You should now be able to create Inventory transfers (Transactions | Inventory | Transfer) to transfer the remaining quantities from the Via site to the To site.
