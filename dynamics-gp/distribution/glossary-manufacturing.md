You’ll probably set up several AQL tables to reflect different inspection standards for different items.

**Active routing**

See *Manufacturing order routing*.

**Actual costing**

An inventory tracking method that involves constantly updating inventor yeach time an item is added or removed.

**Actual demand**

The total quantity of an item requested on all firm manufacturing orders.

**Actual expenses (Job Costing)**

The total of all applied expense transactions linked to a job.

**Actual margin (Job Costing)**

A measure of the overall profitability of a specific job. The actual margin for a job is calculated by dividing the actual profit by the actual revenue, and then multiplying the result by 100.

**Backflushing**

A method of accounting for the use of resources—labor and machine time, and items—based on standards you’ve defined. Transactions to account for the use of backflushed resources are created when a manufacturing order is closed.

**Backward finite scheduling**

A scheduling method that starts from a due date and works out a plan for the flow of work through the plant with the assumption that there are only a limited number of resources (machines and workers) available to complete the task.

**Backward infinite scheduling**

A scheduling method that starts from a due date and works out a plan for the flow of work through the plant with the assumption that the plant has unlimited machine and worker capacity.

**Configured price**

The suggested price to charge the customer for a configured item, based on your finished goods price schedule and the selected options.

**Configured routing**

A routing based on the selected options. For example, if you created a configured bill of materials for office chairs and chose plastic components rather than wooden ones, the routing would be modified to exclude the sequences for staining and varnishing the wooden components. Also known as a *configured working routing*.

**Configured Working Routing**

See *Configured routing*.

**Consume**

To use up the quantity that has been issued to WIP—for materials, labor time, or machine time—for a manufacturing order.

**Employee efficiency percentage**

A ranking of how an employee performs a given task. You can use this field different ways, depending on how your organization handles its employee efficiencies. Some organizations complete time studies of various tasks, and set task goals for workers based on those figures. Employees earn efficiency ratings based on their ability to meet those criteria. In other organizations, the top producer is assigned a value of 100% (or less) and all other employees would be ranked in comparison to the top producer.

**ENG BOM**

See Engineering bill of materials.

**Engineering bill of materials**

A proposed bill of materials. Designs that are only in the prototype stage of development, for example, may have engineering bills of materials. In this way, the costs of producing a design can be studied without impacting the material requirements that the system generates.

**Engineering change management (ECM)**

**Explode**

To determine the total quantities of components needed for a manufactured item. To explode a bill of materials, the quantity ordered is multiplied by the quantity used for each of its components. Exploding continues throughout the bill of materials, so component requirements for subassemblies are also calculated.

## F

**Fixed quantity**

The quantity of a component that is required for each manufacturing order, regardless of how many finished goods are produced with the order. For example, if you use two widgets to calibrate equipment each time you begin a new manufacturing order, the fixed quantity for widgets would be 2 for the finished good bill of materials.

**Floor stock**

A bill of materials component that uses the same site for its issue-from and issue-to sites. The cost of this type of floor stock is applied to the cost of the finished item. See also *Expensed floor stock*.

## G

**General ledger variance**

The difference between costs that have been added to WIP and the costs that have been removed from WIP for a specific manufacturing order.

## H

**Header record**

The information that ties the pieces of a larger record together. For example, the header record of a routing includes information about the type of routing, the routing name, the date the routing was created and so on. This information ties sequence records together to create one routing record.

**Hours per shift**

The amount of time per shift actually spent working on the assigned tasks. To determine hours available per shift, subtract any nontask related activities from the total number of available hours. For example, if an employee is scheduled for an eight-hour shift but has a one-hour meeting and two quarter-hour breaks that day, the total available time would be 6.5 hours.

## I

**Inclusions**

Option items automatically added to a configured bill of materials when a customer selects a certain option. For example, a computer manufacturer might offer a computer system in tan and black. If the customer selects the option for a tan computer, the computer manufacturer might set up the super bill of materials so that the tan keyboard automatically is included as part of the purchase.

**Indirect labor**

The time spent on tasks that are not directly related to filling a specific manufacturing order. Examples of indirect labor include meetings and training.

**Instruction sheet**

See *Routing*.

**Infinite scheduling**

A scheduling method that assumes that all required capacity for labor and machines is always available.

**Invoice history**

The information tracked about past invoices. Invoice history allows you to determine what historical information you will need for tracking sales activity. History information can include transaction detail and/or account distributions.

**Issue**

A type of component transaction. When components are issued for a manufacturing order, they are removed from inventory and added to WIP.

**Issue-from location**

The site where the components used in the manufacturing process are stored prior to beginning the manufacturing order, such as with a vendor, or in a department, a warehouse, or another plant.

**Issue-to location**

**Make item**

An item that is produced by your plant.

**Make or Buy item**

Item that can be bought or manufactured by your company.

**Make to order**

An order fulfillment method for made items. When make-to-order items are sold, manufacturing orders to build the items required to fulfill the manufacturing orders are created. Manufacturing orders are used to respond to specific sales orders.

**Make to stock**

An order fulfillment method for made items. When make-to-stock items are sold, the quantities required to fulfill the sales order are taken from inventory quantities. Manufacturing orders are used to keep inventory levels up so that sales orders can be fulfilled.

**Manufacturing bill of materials**

The bill of materials used to build a parent part in your organization. A manufacturing bill of materials is the “real” bill of materials, and is used to figure material requirements for your organization.

**Material Requirements Planning**

A series of data collection and interpretation procedures that allow you to forecast resource requirements over a specified time period (days, weeks or months).

**Maximum order size**

One of the variables that can be used to calculate order quantities for fixed or period order quantity order policies. Maximum order size puts a limit on the size of automatically generated purchase and manufacturing orders. If demand is greater than the maximum order size, an additional order will be created.

**MFG BOM**

See *Manufacturing bill of materials*.

**Minimum order size**

One of the variables that can be used to calculate order quantities for fixed or period order quantity order policies. It is similar to standard order quantity, and is used in its place if the standard order quantity is zero. If the standard order quantity is greater than zero, the standard order quantity supersedes the minimum order size.

**Module security**

A way to see if other users are working with records that prevent you from completing certain processes. Module security also allows you to unlock records and remove users from MRP.

**Move in**

To adjust the due dates of existing manufacturing orders and purchase orders to meet potential shortages identified by MRP calculations. If MRP calculations uncover a shortage of an item and if there’s an existing order for the item in the future, the order will be flagged to be “moved in” to prevent the shortage.

**Move out**

To reschedule certain manufacturing orders or purchase orders to prevent stock overages on the current due date. An appropriate future date to move the order to cover a future net requirement is proposed.

**Move time**

**Multi-level bill of materials**

A bill of materials that lists all the components directly or indirectly involved in building the parent part, together with the required quantity for each item. For example, if a subassembly is used in the parent part, the multi-level bill of materials will show all the components needed to build the subassembly, including purchased parts and materials. See also *Single-level bill of materials*.

## N

**Negative WIP**

The situation that occurs if you enter and post a manufacturing order receipt where more is consumed from WIP than was in WIP for the manufacturing order. When finished goods are received into inventory before materials have been issued to the order or before labor or machine time data collection transactions have been completed, this can occur. You must set up Manufacturing Order Processing to be able to enter receipts that would cause negative WIP.

**Net change regeneration**

An MRP process that updates MRP information based on changes to manufacturing orders, sales orders, purchase orders, and inventory quantities. See also *Full regeneration*.

**Nettable item**

An item, site or item-site combination that is included in MRP calculations.

**Non-nettable item**

Any item, site, or item-site combination that is not included in MRP calculations.

**Option bill of materials**

A bill of materials for a component signifying that the component won’t be identical in all finished products.

**Option category**

A group of related items that customers can choose from, such as various sizes of computer monitors.

**Option setting**

A setting that controls the information that appears on a report, such as sorting method, detail level, and range restriction.

**Order increment**

A variable that can be used to calculate order quantities for fixed or period order quantity order policies. The order increment is the number of item units that can be added to the standard order quantity to increase the order size to meet demand.

**Order policy**

A method for calculating the order sizes of automatically generated purchase and manufacturing orders. Manufacturing includes three order policies: lot-for-lot, fixed order quantity and period order quantity.

**Originating currency**

**Period order quantity**

An order policy type that calculates order size for requirements for a period you specify, based on one or more of these variables: standard order quantity, order increment size, minimum order size, and maximum order size.

**Periodic costing**

See *Standard costing*.

**Periodic inventory**

An inventory tracking method that involves taking inventory on a recurring basis, such as monthly, quarterly or yearly. This is the same as “standard” costing.

**Perpetual inventory**

 An inventory tracking method that involves constantly updating inventory each time an item is added or removed.

**Phantom bill of materials**

A bill of materials used to describe the components of a parent part that will be built as part of a higher-level parent part. The term “phantom” is used to indicate that the part never really exists as a stocked item, but is built along with the production of the higher-level part that is driving an overall production order. Creating bills of materials as phantoms allows the manufacturing order pick list and the Material Requirements Planning (MRP) features to explode through the phantom item down to the lower-level parts.

**Pick document**

 A group of component transactions that share a type such as Allocate, Issue, Reverse Issue, and that are posted together. A pick document can include component transactions for multiple manufacturing orders, items, or sites.

**Pointer routing**

 A pointer routing is used to outline a series of steps that are common to all items produced by your plant. For example, if each item needs to be tested by quality assurance, packaged and shipped, a routing can be defined to cover these steps for all items that you manufacture.

**Post-to site**

 The site where the finished product will be stored prior to delivery to the customer. This location can be a department, a warehouse, or another plant.

**Primary routing**

 A routing that provides the instructions for building an item. It is a basis for scheduling and resource estimates. The primary routing information is used to determine the required lead time for manufacturing the product. Each item can have only one active primary routing.

**Process security**

 A type of security that allows you to restrict access to certain procedures or processes within Manufacturing.

**Process security set**

 A password or list of user IDs you define to restrict authority for completing a Manufacturing process. You can use one process security set for all restricted procedures, or you can create different process security sets for different procedures.

**Return**

An item or merchandise returned by a customer to your company. A return decreases the customer's balance on account and, if you choose, increases inventory quantities.

**Revalue**

To finalize rolled-up standard cost changes. Revaluing replaces existing standard cost information with new standard cost information, which is used in your accounting processes. As you change your standard cost information, you might roll up costs several times, but probably will revalue items only at certain points.

**Revenue/expense code**

 A short identifier used to categorize expenses and revenues linked to a job.

**Reverse allocate**

 A component transaction type where items that have been allocated to a manufacturing order are unallocated. *See also Allocate*.

**Reverse Scrap**

 A component transaction type where components that were scrapped for a manufacturing order are restored to the issued (and not scrapped) quantity for the order. *See also Scrap*.

**Roll up**

 To apply calculations based on changes to standard cost information to items. If you change the cost of a raw material that is part of several subassemblies and finished goods, “rolling up” that change will result in calculations that will determine the new standard costs of the subassemblies and finished goods.
 As you change your standard cost information, you might roll up costs several times, but probably will revalue items only at certain points.

**Routing**

 A detailed set of instructions that describes how to create a particular item. Routings include operations to be performed, the scheduling sequence, machines and work centers involved, and hours required for setup and run times. Routings also can include information about tooling, operator skill levels, inspection needs, testing requirements, and so on.
 In engineering change management, a routing is a list of users who must review an engineering change request before it becomes a change order, and who must review a change order before it's finalized.

**Routing preference**

 An individual user choice on how information is displayed or processed for update in the routings subsystem. Preferences can control such actions as substituting one description for another or appending work center operations notes on to routing notes.

## S

**Sales order**

A request for goods or services. Sales orders can be Open (ready to be filled) or Planned (hold pending credit check or other criteria).

**Sampling**

A statistical process of selecting a portion of a large group of items to be inspected. From the sample you select—and your inspection results for the sample—you can draw inferences about the overall quality of the entire item quantity.

**SCAR**

See *Supplier Corrective Action Request*.

**Scheduling data**

The lead time needed to manufacture an item on a bill of materials and the amount of scrap materials produced by the manufacturing process.

**Scheduling preference**

A user preference that controls the allocation of resources to a particular manufacturing order. Scheduling preferences identify additional resources that may be available and define waiting periods for a sequence.

**Scrap**

A component transaction type where components that are issued to a manufacturing order are flagged to be scrapped. Scrapped component costs are applied to the manufacturing order costs, but the quantities aren’t.

**Sequence number**

A number assigned to a particular step in a routing. Each step (or sequence) represents an operation in the manufacturing process. The sequence number controls the order in which steps are executed.

**Serial-numbered item**

An inventoried item that is assigned a unique identifier, which can be letters, numbers, or a combination of letters and numbers.

**Serial-number–tracked item**

See *Serial-numbered item*.

**Serial-tracked**

See *Serial-numbered item*.

**Setup cost**

The cost of preparing a work area for production. Setup costs might include the cost of calibrating machines or gathering the necessary tools and resources.

**Setup labor code**

A labor code that identifies the skill requirements for the person preparing the work area prior to performing the manufacturing task.

**Setup time**

The number of hours needed to prepare the work area prior to the operation.

**Ship date**

The date when a sales order leaves your warehouse or office.

**Shipping method**

The manner in which the items are transported from the supplier to the manufacturer. Examples of shipping methods include FedEx, rail, air freight, etc.

**Shop calendar**

A calendar of up and down days—days when the plant is in production and when it isn’t—for an entire manufacturing facility.

**Shop order**
See *Manufacturing order*.

**Shop rate**

The average pay rate for the pay grade. It is the figure that is used when labor costs are estimated for a manufacturing order.

**Shrinkage**

The loss of materials. You might have raw material shrinkage—such as when some component items are defective and can't be used in manufacturing—or you might have parent part shrinkage—such as when not all manufactured items meet your product standards.

**Single-level bill of materials**

A bill of materials that lists components and subassemblies, including the quantities of each, that make up the parent part. See also *Multi-level bill of materials*.

**Site**

A location that you have defined for storing items. A site could be a department, a plant, or a warehouse. The number of sites depends on your organizational structure.

**Source routing**

A previously defined routing that contains one or more steps that you want to use in a new routing.

**Standard cost variance**

The difference between the actual costs for a manufacturing order for a standard cost item, and the standard cost of the item.

**Standard costing**

An accounting method used by some businesses to value their inventories. A company that uses standard costing—also known as “periodic costing”—revalues its inventory periodically to reflect significant changes in the cost of its items.

**Standard order quantity**

A variable that can be used to calculate order quantities for fixed or period order quantity order policies. It is similar to a minimum order quantity, requiring no less than a set amount for an order, but it can be increased, either by increments or multiples of the standard order quantity.

**Subassembly**

A part that is both a component and a parent part. An assembly that is used in the manufacture of a higher-order assembly.

**Super bill of materials**

A list of all the component items that can possibly be included the bill of materials for a finished item. For example, a computer manufacturer might develop a super bill of materials that includes several options for hard disks, RAM, monitors, keyboards, mice and other peripherals. No computer can include all the options, but all the options must be included in the super bill of materials.

**SUPER BOM**

See *Super bill of materials*.

**Supplier**

A person or company that supplies goods or services to a manufacturer.

**Supplier Corrective Action Request**

A formal report to be sent to a supplier to involve the supplier in
resolving problems with defective parts. SCARs describe the problems you’ve
found—including item numbers, lot numbers, dates and test results—and might
outline possible areas for the supplier to research to prevent the defect
from recurring. Suppliers usually are required to respond to the SCAR
reports with information about the cause of the defect and the steps to be
taken to prevent its recurrence.

## T

**Template**

A routing outline that you can use to quickly and efficiently build new
routings. Each time you need to create a new routing, you can customize the
template and give it a unique routing name.

**Time fence**

The minimum amount of time required for production of an item. When MRP is used to create planned manufacturing orders or purchase orders, the orders automatically are scheduled outside the time fence.

**Total costs**

The cumulative total of all expenses associated with a manufacturing order, plus any overhead that might not be directly connected to the order.

**Trade discount**

A price reduction, usually granted to a certain customer because of the customer’s special status. Customers with an excellent credit history might be offered a trade discount.

## U

**Unit costs**

The value of time and resources consumed to create one unit of product for this order.

**Unmet forecasted demand**

The difference between forecasted demand (the anticipated amount of an item that will be required to meet projected orders) and actual production.

**Up day**

A day when the facility—the entire shop floor or a specific work center—is in production.

**User-defined field**

A field that can be used to track information specific to your company.

## V

**Valuation method**

The process used to track inventory value (FIFO Perpetual, FIFO Periodic, LIFO Perpetual, LIFO Periodic, Average Perpetual).

**Variance**

The difference between two values, such as the difference between estimated and actual expenses.

## W

**Where used**

A Manufacturing query that scans your bills of materials and routings to find where items, machines and other things you’ve defined are used. If you performed a “where used” search for all items in your plant that use a certain machine, for instance, the system would generate a list of all items that have a step involving that machine.

**Window security**

A system that allows you to specify which windows each user in your organization will be able to use.

**Work center**

A self-contained unit of the manufacturing process, or an entire plant. A work center might be an assembly area, a shipping and receiving area or a painting area. Machines and employees are the main components of work centers.

**Work center calendar**

A calendar of up and down days—days when the plant is in production and when it isn’t—for a specific work center.

**Working routing**

See *Manufacturing order routing*.

**Work In Process (WIP)**

A system that helps you to track and analyze the costs associated with a particular manufacturing order and view the progress of the manufacturing order.
