# Project Accounting Cost Management

The Project Accounting Cost Management Guide includes information for project managers about how to use Microsoft Dynamics GP Project Accounting to estimate and track project costs. It also includes information about how to specify how billing amounts, revenue, and profit should be calculated, based on project costs.

You can use Project Accounting to set up the various cost categories to use for projects. A cost category determines how cost, the billing amount, revenue, and profit are calculated for a specific activity. You can assign cost categories to a project budget and use the budget to estimate and track project performance. You also can assign fees to a project.

You must enter information about the employees and equipment that you will use as resources for projects. You can create rate tables to specify how much customers should be billed for employees and equipment. Using timesheets and employee expense transactions, you can track the time that employees spend on projects and the expenses they incur. You can use equipment logs to track how equipment is used for a projects, and use miscellaneous logs to track miscellaneous expenses for a project that can't be tracked using other transactions.

You can purchase items for projects and receive them using Purchase Order Processing, and then enter inventory transfers to make the items that you purchase available for projects in Project Accounting.

Projects must be assigned to a contract. You can create multiple contracts for a customer, and a contract can include one or more projects.
This introduction is divided into the following sections:

## Part 1: Resource planning

This part of the documentation includes information for project managers about setting up employee, vendor, equipment, and miscellaneous records for tracking project costs and billing customers. The documentation also includes information about how to create rate tables for calculating project costs, overhead, and profit.

It also includes information about how to create unit of measure schedules and about default unit costs and how overhead is calculated.

- *Chapter 1, "Unit quantities, costs, and overhead,"* includes information about how to create unit of measure schedules. It also includes information about default unit costs and how overhead is calculated.

### Chapter 1: Unit quantities, costs, and overhead

This part of the documentation includes information for project managers about how to create unit of measure schedules. It also includes information about default unit costs and how overhead is calculated.
The following topics are discussed.

- *Create a unit of measure schedule*

- *Default unit costs*

- *Total cost*

- *Overhead calculation methods*

#### Create a unit of measure schedule

You can set up a unit of measure schedule to define the quantities that your business buys or sells items in. A unit of measure schedule is a group of related quantities.

1. Open the PA Unit of Measure Schedule Setup window.

**Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \> Tools \> Setup \> Project \> Unit of Measure Schedule**

1. Enter a unit of measure schedule ID and description.

2. You can click **Copy** to select a unit of measure schedule to copy information from.

3. Select the number of decimal places for the quantities that you're entering in the unit of measure schedule.

4. Enter the name for the base unit of measure. It is the smallest quantity in the schedule and typically has a quantity of 1. For example, **EACH** might be used as the base unit of measure. The name that you enter for the base unit of measure will be displayed on the first line of the scrolling window. 

5. In the **U of M** field enter the name for another quantity. In the **Quantity** field enter the number of units of the base unit of measure that make up the quantity. In the **Equivalent** field enter the name of the base unit of measure.
Click **Save** and close the window.

> [!NOTE]
> For each quantity that you enter, you first must identify how that quantity is equivalent to the base unit of measure. You then can identify how the quantity is equivalent to other quantities in the schedule.*


#### Default unit costs

Unit costs are used to calculate the total cost for a line item on a cost
transaction using the following formula.

Total cost = (Quantity x Unit Cost) + Overhead

When you set up cost transactions for tracking project costs, you can select the default unit cost to use for cost transactions.

**None** Don't use a default unit cost for the cost transaction.

**Employee** Use the unit cost for the employee record. 

**Budget** Use the unit cost for the cost category in the project budget. 

**Cost Category** Use the unit cost for the cost category record. 

**Equipment** Use the unit cost for the equipment record. 

**Miscellaneous** Use the unit cost for the miscellaneous record. 
See *Part 5, Project cost tracking*, for more information.

#### Total cost

How total cost is calculated for projects depends on the project type and
accounting method.

For the **Time and Materials** project type, if the accounting method for
the project is **When Performed**, cost transaction amounts are included in
total cost when the transactions are posted. If the accounting method is
**When Billed**, cost transaction amounts are included in total cost when
billing invoices are posted for those cost transaction amounts.

For the **Fixed Price** and **Cost Plus** project types, only cost
transaction amounts that have been recognized as revenue using the revenue
recognition routine are included in total cost.

See *Accounting methods and recognizing revenue* on page 27 in the Project
Accounting Accounting Control Guide for more information.

#### Overhead calculation methods

There are two overhead calculation methods that you can use to include overhead in project costs.

**Amount per Unit** Overhead is a flat amount that is added to the unit cost for each single unit quantity of time or an item.

**Percentage of Actual Cost** Overhead is a percentage of the actual cost for each single unit quantity of time or an item.

If the quantity or cost of a single unit of time or an item is not available when calculating overhead, overhead will be calculated as the total cost for the transaction divided by the unit cost or unit quantity, whichever is available. If neither is available, overhead will be the total cost for the transaction.

#### Contract, project, and cost category statuses

The status of a contract, project, or cost category determines whether you
can enter cost or billing transactions, recognize revenue, or close a
project. Except for the **Closed** status, you can change the status of a
project from any status to another at any time.

You can use up to 10 statuses, including five default statuses and up to
five userdefined statuses. See *Enter names for user-defined statuses for
tracking Open projects* on page 46 for more information.

There are five default statuses.

##### Estimate

When you create a new contract or project, or when you assign a cost
category to a project budget, the default status will be **Estimate**
because it prevents users from entering cost transactions. When a project
has an **Estimate** status, you can assign new cost categories to project
budgets and enter baseline budget amounts. You also can delete cost
categories from project budgets.

When you're ready to enter cost transactions, bill customers, and recognize
revenue, change the status to **Open**.

Because the **Estimate** status prevents users from entering cost transactions,
you also can use the status to suspend cost accrual for a entire project or for
an individual cost category in a project budget. You can enter change orders for
contracts and projects that have an **Estimate** status, however.

You can change the status of a contract to **Estimate** or **Open** at any time,
even after changing the status of the contract to **Closed**.

##### Open

You typically select the **Open** status after you've entered baseline amounts
for a project budget and you're ready to enter cost transactions for the
project.

When you change the status of a contract from **Estimate** to **Open**, you will
be asked whether to change the status of all projects in the contract to
**Open**.

If you select the **Open** status, you can't modify baseline budget amounts or
delete cost categories from project budgets. You can modify forecast budget
amounts and, as you post cost transactions, actual amounts will be updated. You
can enter new projects for contracts that are in the **Open** status. You also
can bill customers and recognize revenue.

##### On Hold

To temporarily prevent cost and billing transactions from being entered and to
prevent revenue recognition, select the **On Hold** status. You can enter change
orders, however.

##### Completed

When you change the status of a project to **Completed**, you will be asked
whether to change the statuses of all cost categories in the project budget to
**Completed**.

*If you change the status of a cost category in a Fixed Price project budget to
Completed, the cost category will become 100% complete.*

You can continue to enter cost and billing transactions and recognize revenue.

##### Closed

When all cost and billing transactions have been posted, all customer payments
received, and all revenue has been recognized for a project, you can close the
project. You can close only projects that have a **Completed** status. After you
close a project the status will be **Closed**. See *Close projects* on page 114
for more information.

When all projects in a contract have been closed, the status of the contract
will be **Closed**.

#### Enter names for user-defined statuses for tracking Open projects

You can enter names for up to five additional statuses to be used for
contracts, projects, and cost categories in project budgets. The statuses
that you name will be equivalent to the **Open** status. You can use these
named statuses to track the status of **Open** projects according to your
business processes.

Profit types are used to determine profit and calculate billing amounts.

##### Profit types for all project types

You can use the following profit types for **Time and Materials**, **Cost
Plus**, and **Fixed Price** projects.

**None** Billing amounts are always zero.

**Price Level** Billing amounts are calculated using price levels for
inventoried items included in cost categories.

##### Profit types for Time and Materials projects only

You can use the following profit types for **Time and Materials** projects.

**Billing Rate** You can enter a flat amount for the billing rate. Billing
amounts will be calculated using quantities and the billing rate.

**Markup %** You can enter a percentage for the markup. Billing amounts will
be calculated using actual cost, plus a percentage markup of actual cost.

##### Profit types for Cost Plus projects only

You can use the following profit type for **Cost Plus** projects.

**Profit/Unit - Variable** You can enter a flat amount for profit. Billing
amounts will be calculated using actual cost, plus the profit for each unit
quantity. You can change the flat amount for profit when the project is
**Open**.

##### Profit types for Cost Plus and Fixed Price projects

You can use the following profit types for **Cost Plus** and **Fixed Price**
projects.

**% of Actual** You can enter a percentage. Billing amounts will be
calculated using a percentage of actual cost.

**% of Baseline** You can enter a percentage. Billing amounts will be
calculated using a percentage of the baseline budget amount.

**Profit/Unit - Fixed** You can enter a flat amount. Billing amounts will be
calculated using actual cost plus the flat amount for each unit quantity.

**Total Profit** You can enter a flat amount. The billing amount will be the
flat amount.

#### Default profit types

When you set up cost transactions for tracking project costs, you can select
the default profit type to use for cost transactions.

**Employee** Use the profit type for the employee record. See *Set up an
employee record for tracking project costs and billing customers* on page 14
for more information.

### Chapter 10: Benefit Allocation

This part of the documentation includes information on how employee benefits
are allocated to a project to reflect the true cost of the work performed.
The following topics are discussed:

- *Understanding benefit allocation*

- *Process the benefit allocation*

#### Understanding benefit allocation

You can use benefit allocation to allocate expenses incurred on employee
benefits to specific projects. Each benefit in Payroll that has an employer
expense component is assigned to a Project Accounting cost category. The
cost of the benefit is allocated to the project based on hours or currency
units. The allocation of a benefit to a project is determined on the basis
of the project timesheet that is transferred to a payroll batch. Benefits
entered directly in a payroll batch are not allocated to projects.

When you post a payroll batch with the benefits allocated in the project
accounting timesheet, a benefit allocation process should be run. This
process splits the benefits proportionately among the projects that the
employee worked on.

For related information, see *Associate benefits with a cost category or
cost category class* on page 53, and *Allocate benefits to accounts* on page
54.

#### Process the benefit allocation

You can process the allocation of benefits to the project using the Benefit
Allocation window.

1. Open the Benefit Allocation window.

**Microsoft Dynamics GP menu \> Tools \> Routines \> Projects \> Benefit
Allocation**

![Screenshot of the Benefit Allocation window.](media/PACM%2030.jpg)

    more information.

After processing is complete, a report will be printed, listing any errors
that occurred.

### Chapter 11: Fees

This part of the documentation includes information for project managers
about fees, including **Project**, **Retainer**, **Retentions**, and
**Service** fees, and how to create fee records for them.

The types of fees that you can include in a project depends on whether
you're using a **Cost Plus**, **Fixed Price**, or **Time and Materials**
project. Various fee frequencies and fee calculation methods can be used for
fees, depending on the fee type.

The following topics are discussed:

- *Types of fees*

- *Create a Project fee*

- *Create a Retainer fee*

- *Create a Retentions fee*

#### Types of fees

There are four types of fees that you can bill customers for.

**Project** A flat amount billed using a fee schedule, or a percentage of
total baseline project costs or revenue that you can bill during each
billing cycle using a fee schedule or after the project is complete.

**Retainer** A flat amount billed using a fee schedule. **Retainer** fee
amounts are held on account and can be applied to billing amounts. See
*Enter payments, taxes, and other charges for a billing invoice* on page 36
in the Project Accounting Billing Guide for more information.

**Retentions** A percentage of total baseline project costs that isn't
billed until the project status is **Completed**. This fee is for **Cost
Plus** and **Fixed Price** projects only. You also can hold a portion of a
**Project** fee in retention.

**Service** An flat amount billed using a fee schedule. This fee is for
**Time and Materials** projects only.

is for a percentage of the final total that is calculated using forecast
budget amounts. As costs rise for the project, your company's profit remains
the same.

##### Fixed Price

The customer pays a predetermined amount for the entire project. Each
billing invoice is for a percentage of the predetermined total billing
amount. As costs rise for the project, your company's profit decreases.

##### Time and Materials

The customer is billed for project costs as they are incurred. The amount
that the customer is billed is based on billing rates or markup percentages
for time and materials used for the project. Time includes the time that
employees spend working on a project and for equipment used for the project.
Materials include inventoried and non-inventoried items used for the
project.
