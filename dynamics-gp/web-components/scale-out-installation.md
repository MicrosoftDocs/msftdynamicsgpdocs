## Creating a session

After you have verified that the session host machines are working, verify that you can access the web client.

1. Open Internet Explorer.

2. Enter the URL of the Dynamics GP web client site. The default address of the site is:

    `https://ServerName:PortNumber/GP`

    **ServerName** is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the server that is hosting the web site. This name must match the name you used when you requested the security certificate that you applied to the site when setting up SSL.

    **PortNumber** is the port for the web site that you are using. If you chose to install on the default web site (port 443) then you do not need to supply the port number.

    A typical URL to access the Dynamics GP web client looks similar to the following:

    `https://gpuaweb.contoso.com/GP`

3. After entering the URL, you will be directed to the logon page. This is the first page that will be displayed to users who are accessing the Dynamics GP web client using a Windows Account. A deployment where users will use an Organizational Account for access will be redirected to the Azure sign in page.

    ![shows the login screen to dynamics gp in the browser.](media/install-web-login-03.png "GP login")  

4. Enter your user credentials. These are domain user credentials or machine user credentials for a user that is part of the security group you created to control access to the Dynamics GP web client. This security group is described in Chapter 5, “Security groups and user accounts.” These are not your Dynamics GP login name and password. Enter your Organization Account credentials, if prompted, on the Azure sign-in page.

    Click **Sign In**.

5. A session will be created. The window you see first will depend on settings for your Dynamics GP user. Log in with your Dynamics GP login name and password.

    - If your Dynamics GP user ID has Directory Account information, the Dynamics GP login window will be displayed.

        ![shows the login screen to dynamics gp using sql login.](media/install-web-login-01.png "GP login")  

        Log in with your Dynamics GP login name and password.

    - If your Dynamics GP user ID has Directory Account information, the Web Client SQL User will be used to access Dynamics GP data.

        **One company**: If you have access to only one company, that company will automatically be used. The first page you see in Dynamics GP will be

        **Multiple companies**: If you have access to multiple companies, the Company Login window will be displayed, allowing you to select the company to use.

![shows the login screen to a dynamics gp company.](media/install-web-login-02.png "GP login")  

## Verify the service based architecture installation

After the Dynamics GP service based architecture installation is complete, verify that you can access service based architecture.

These verification steps are for Windows and Mixed Mode authentication types only. An Organizational Account only deployment will require an application or tool that will obtain an Organizational Account user token from Microsoft Entra ID.

1. Open a browser.

2. Enter the URL to the discovery service. The default address is:

    `https://ServerName:PortNumber/GPService/Tenants(DefaultTenant)/help`

    **ServerName**   is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the server that is hosting the web components. This name must match the name you used when you requested the security certificate that you applied to the site when setting up SSL.

    **PortNumber**   is the port for the web site that you are using. If you chose to install on the default port (port 443) then you do not need to supply the port number.

    **DefaultTenant**   is the tenant name in a single tenant deployment.

    A typical URL to access the Dynamics GP service based architecture looks similar to the following:

    `https://gpuaweb.contoso.com/GPService/Tenants(DefaultTenant)/help`

3. After entering the URL, you may be prompted for your Windows credentials. Enter your user credentials. These are domain user credentials or machine user credentials that has been assigned to your GP user ID.
