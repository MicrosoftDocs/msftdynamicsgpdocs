# Repairing the web client

If the Dynamics GP web client installation becomes damaged, the repair operations available may help resolve the issues. Information about repairing is divided into the following sections:

- [Common repair scenarios](#common-repair-scenarios)  

- [Performing a repair](#performing-a-repair)  

## Common repair scenarios

When using the Dynamics GP web client, there are some common scenarios that can be fixed through using a repair operation.

### Corrupted configuration

The Dynamics GP web client has numerous configurable components. If something has corrupted the configuration for one of these components, the repair action can return the component to its originally installed condition.

### Expired security certificates

The security certificates that are used in the web client installation have a finite lifespan. When a security certificate expires, it will no longer function properly in the web client installation. The security certificate must be replaced. After the new security certificate is installed into the certificate store on the machine, you can select the new certificate during the web client repair process.

### Changed user credentials

If the credentials (user name and/or password) have changed for one of the user accounts that is used in the web client installation, the web client will not work correctly. For instance, one of the services for the web client may not start. You can supply the updated credentials as part of the web client repair process.

1. Log in to the machine where the repair operation is to be performed.
