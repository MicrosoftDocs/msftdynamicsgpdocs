## Chapter 9: Configuring Tenants
After you install Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Services, you can add tenants,
tenant users, and the multitenant applications for each tenant. To add, configure, or
remove tenants, you use the Tenant Manager snap-in of the Web Management
Console.

The following sections describes how to add, configure, and remove tenants, tenant
users, and multitenant applications:

- Before you start
- To add a tenant
- To add a tenant user
- To add and configure a tenant application
- To update or remove a tenant
- To update or remove tenant users
- To update or remove tenant applications

### Before you start
Before you add a tenant, you might have to install a new instance of Microsoft
Dynamics GP. To add an instance of Microsoft Dynamics GP, you customize the
name of the instance during the install. You have to provide a unique name for each
instance of Microsoft Dynamics GP in your multitenant environment.

For example, the default name for the first instance of Microsoft Dynamics GP is
GP2013. You can use this instance with the first tenant in your multitenant
environment.

To add an second instance of GP to a multitenant environment, you use the
Microsoft Dynamics GP installer. The following illustration shows the Instance
Selection window from the install. To add a new GP instance to your multitenant
environment, click Create new instance, and then type a name that uniquely
identifies that instance. Notice how the instance name is specified as CONTOSO.

![config four](media/tenant-services-config-admin-04.PNG "config four")

You also have to specify a name for the system database for the new instance. The
following illustration shows how to specify the SQL Server and the name of the
system database for the Contoso instance of GP.

![config five](media/tenant-services-config-admin-05.PNG "config five")

Typically, you use the GP instance name in the application property of an
multitenant application for a tenant. For example, the Microsoft Dynamics GP Web
Client has the DynamicsexeLocation property that specifies the instance for the web
client.

### To add a tenant

## Chapter 11: Troubleshooting
If you encounter problems with Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Services, the
following sections may be helpful. They describe some of the most common
situations that can occur when using tenant services. The following items are
discussed:

- Tenant Services do not start
- Error occurs when opening the Web Management Console
- Login problems with the Tenant Manager snap-in
- Tenant Manager requests the service URL
- Error when starting a multitenant application
- View the Tenant Manager exception log
- Check the service configuration files
- Enable error messages to provide additional information
- Enable logging for the Web Client application


### Tenant Services do not start
After you install Tenant Services, you view Services in the Server Manager and find
that the Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Discovery Service and the Microsoft
Dynamics GP Tenant Management Service have not started. You attempt to start
both services but neither will run.

The login you used may not have sufficient privileges to initialize the service on the
server. Use Local User and Groups in Server Manager and add the login to the
Administrators group. Try starting each service again. The services should start and
run.

### Error occurs when opening the Web Management Console
You have installed the Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Management Console but you
see the following error when you open the console in Internet Explorer.

```
HTTP Error 500.21 -Internal Server Error
Handler “PageHandlerFactory - Integrated” has a bad module
“ManagedPipelineHandler” in its module list.
```

This error can occur when ASP.NET has not been successfully installed on the
server. To correct the specified issue, open a command prompt with administrator
privileges and navigate to the following folder:

`c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\framework64\v4.0.30319\`

Type the following command and press enter:

`aspnet_regiis -i`

The command installs the specified .NET framework and should eliminate the error
message. After you complete the install, you should run the IIS reset command
(iisreset) to restart the web server.

### Login problems with the Tenant Manager snap-in
After installing Tenant Services, you are unable to open the Tenant Manager in the
Web Management Console. To open the Tenant Manager, you need to be logged in
as a service administrator for Tenant Services.

When you install Tenant Services, your login is added as a service administrator for
Tenant Services. However, you also need to supply a login for the application pool
for the Web Management Console. The specified login is added as a delegating user
for Tenant Services.

A login cannot be both a service administrator and a delegating user. Be sure that
you used a different login for the application pool. If you used the same login for
the application pool identity that you use to install Tenant Service, you might not be
able access the Tenant Manager console.

To use the Tenant Manager in the Web Management Console, be sure that you login
with the ID of the service administrator. Verify that you are logged in with the login
ID you used to install Tenant Services or another ID that is specified as a service
administrator.

### Tenant Manager requests the service URL
When you attempt to open the Tenant Manager in the Web Management Console,
you see the following error message:

![config eleven](media/tenant-services-config-admin-11.PNG "config eleven")

Verify the Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Management Service is running. You will
not be able to use Tenant Manager until the service is started.

### Error when starting a multitenant application
You start the web client or other multitenant application and receive an unexpected
error.

Verify the Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Discovery Service is running. You will
not be able to use the application until the service is running.

If you use the public discovery service to support additional multitenant
applications, you should verify the Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Public
Discovery Service is running. The multitenant applications that rely on that service
will not be able to connect to Microsoft Dynamics GP until that service is started.

### View the Tenant Manager exception log
The Tenant Manager of the Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Management Console
includes a list of tenant services exceptions. The following illustration shows the
console.

![config twelve](media/tenant-services-config-admin-12.PNG "config twelve")

To view detailed error information, click the error in the list you want to view more
information. Click the Error Details button at the bottom of the page. The Error
Details shows more complete information and additional details about the error.

### Check the service configuration files
The default Microsoft Dynamics GP Tenant Services installation adds two Windows
services to your computer. The installer initially configures each service and stores
the configuration information in an XML file. These XML configuration files contain
elements that have attributes and values that control the operation of the service.

To understand the behavior of a service, you can view the configuration
information in the file. In addition, you can change value to reflect changes in your
environment.

The XML configuration file for the discovery service is named:

`Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Discovery.config`

You can find the file in the following location:

`c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Tenant Services\DiscoveryService`

The management service has an XML configuration file named

`Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Management.config. `

You can find the file in the following location:

`c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Tenant Services\ManagementService`

The public discovery service has an XML configuration file named
Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Discovery.Public.config. You can find the
file in the following location:

`c:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Tenant Services\PublicDiscoveryService`

Be sure to make a copy of the configuration file before you make any changes to the
file. You can use the saved copy to restore the original configuration settings for the
service.

### Enable error messages to provide additional information
Change the setting in the XML configuration file for the discovery or management
service. You can change the includeExceptionDetailInFaults attribute to the
serviceDebug node to true.

You can use this setting when you are debugging an issue to get the complete error
message. You will see more information about the exception which can help you
identify the cause of the exception.

When you are done, set the value of the includeExceptionDetailInFaults attribute to
false. If you do not restore the original settings, everyone who uses the service will
get the detailed error messages.

You can find includeExceptionDetailInFaults in the following service configuration
files:

- Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Discovery.config
- Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Management.config
- Microsoft.Dynamics.MultitenantServices.Discovery.Public.config

The previous section provides the typical location of each configuration file.

### Enable logging for the Web Client application
The Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Client application includes properties you can use
to enable logging for a tenant or tenant user. You can use the logs to help identify
activity surrounding issues you might encounter while using the Web Client in a
multitenant environment.

You can have the Web Client tenant application produce the following logs:

Name | Description
-|-
Runtime log | The primary log you use to record and view web client activity. The log records information about service calls, client actions, generated macro lines, and Dexterity callbacks.
Script log | Enables the Dexterity script log you can use when you debug sanScript code
Sql log | Enables the same type of logging that you get when you enable SQL logging in the Dex.ini file. The log contains information about the connection to the SQL server and the queries to that server.
Timing log | The log you use to record the timing information for messages, script execution, callbacks, and other events. You enable this log to gather information you can use to monitor performance for an event or action.

To enable logging, the Web Client application includes the following properties:

Property | Description
-|-
RuntimeLogEnabled | This property enables you to create the runtime log for a tenant. The default value for the property is false. To start the Runtime log, set the property to true.
CustomRuntimeSettings | This property enables you to create more detailed log information for scripts, SQL server activity, and the time for specified actions and events. The property includes a parameter for each type of log. The parameters are named ScriptLogEnabled, TimingLogEnabled, and SqlLogEnabled. The default value for the each parameter is false. To start a log, you set the value for that log parameter to true.

You can determine what information goes into a log file by where you enable the
log.

- If you set the property to true in the Application Settings of the Tenant
Properties window, the log contains information for all Web Client users for the
tenant.
- If you set the property to true in the Application Settings section of the Tenant
Users window, the log contains information for the specified tenant user.

After you enable logging, you can find the generated log in the following location:

`%Program Data%\Microsoft Dynamics\GP Sessions\Logs\`

When you have completed your analysis, be sure to return the value of the log
properties to false.
