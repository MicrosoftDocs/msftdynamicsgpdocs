# Dynamics GP environment configuration

Before you can install the Dynamics GP web components, you must have Dynamics GP installed, including the necessary web client runtime and/ or service based architecture components.

## Dynamics GP installation

Dynamics GP should be installed, configured, and operating properly before you use the web components installation to install the Web Client or Service Based Architecture server components for Dynamics GP. While most administrative tasks can be performed with the web client, some important tasks such as creating companies cannot. These actions must be done with the Dynamics GP desktop client and GP Utilities.

Each server that will be acting as a session host must have a Dynamics GP desktop client installation installed. Use the desktop client to verify that the server is able to connect to the Dynamics GP database.

## Web Client SQL Server login

During the Dynamics GP installation, a SQL Server login is created that web client and service based architecture sessions can use to access SQL Server. By using the single Web Client SQL Server login, each web client and service based architecture user doesn't need to have their own SQL Server login. Web client users can access the web client simply by providing their standard Windows login credentials or their Organizational Account. Service Based Architecture users must access Dynamics GP using either their Windows login credentials or their Organizational Account.

During the Dynamics GP web components installation, you will need to know the name and password for the Web Client SQL Server login. You can use Dynamics GP Utilities to configure or make changes to the Web Client SQL Server login for your Dynamics GP installation.

## Web client only users

It’s likely that you will have some users that will be accessing only the Dynamics GP web client and will never use the desktop client. You can set up these users in Dynamics GP as web client only users.

In the **User Setup** window, mark the **Web Client user only (no SQL Server Account)** option. The **SQL Server Account** tab will be disabled, because the user you are adding to Dynamics GP will not have a SQL Server login. On the **Directory Account** tab, you will supply the Windows login information for the user.

When the user signs in to the web client, they simply provide their Windows Login or organizational account credentials. The web client will determine the user ’s Dynamics GP user ID based on the credentials. The Web Client SQL Server login (discussed in the previous section) is used to access the SQL Server databases.

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that users who do not sign in to the web client using their own SQL Server login cannot send remote processes to the Distributed Process Server.  

## Web client runtime components

Each session host server must have the Dynamics GP web client runtime and service based architecture components. These components are part of the Dynamics GP installation. To install these components, complete the following procedure:

To install the web client runtime components

1. Open the Programs and Features control panel.

2. Select the Dynamics GP application, and then click Change.

3. In the Program Maintenance window, click Add/Remove Features.

4. Be sure that the Web Client Runtime feature is marked to be installed.

5. Click Next to continue, and then click Install to complete the installation process.

6. Click Exit.

To install the service based architecture components

1. Open the Programs and Features control panel.

2. Select the Dynamics GP application and then click Change.

3. In the Program Maintenance window, click Add/Remove Features.

4. Be sure that the Service Based Architecture feature is marked to be installed.

5. Click Next to continue, and then click Install to complete the installation process.

6. Click Exit.
