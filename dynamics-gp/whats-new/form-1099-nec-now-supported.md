# Form 1099 NEC

The IRS is releasing a new 1099 NEC form for the 2020 tax year. Non-Employee Compensation, which had been included in the 1099 MISC form, has been moved to its own form.

In the Vendor Card in Options, you now have the option of selecting **Nonemployee Compensation** as a 1099 tax type. The Utility "Update 1099 Information" also includes selecting **Nonemployee Compensation**.

To access the Nonemployee Compensation tax type, choose **Purchasing**, select **Cards**, and then choose **Vendor**. Once you choose a vendor, click **Options**. In the **Tax Type** drop down menu, select **Nonemployee Compensation**.

To make a Mass Update, go to **Purchasing**, choose **Utilities**, and then select **Update 1099 Information**. Then make the selections in this window for Tax Type From and To.
