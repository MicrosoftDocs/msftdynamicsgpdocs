# Upgrade checklist

You can upgrade to Dynamics GP from specific versions of Dynamics GP. For the supported upgrade paths, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2018](/dynamics/s-e/).  

## When to upgrade

Before upgrading, we recommend that you create a timetable of the entire upgrade process. This timetable can include the scheduling of a test upgrade, live upgrade, upgrade training, and implementation. Be sure that the scheduled time to upgrade takes place during a time that works best for all Dynamics GP users and for your information technology (IT) staff. You may not want to upgrade before processing payroll checks or closing a year.
