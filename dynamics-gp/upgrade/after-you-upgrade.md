# After you upgrade

We recommend that you complete the steps in this chapter after you upgrade all Dynamics GP databases. After you’ve completed these steps, see [Module upgrades from Dynamics GP 2013](module-upgrades-from-microsoft-dynamics-gp-2013.md) to complete additional procedures that are necessary after you’ve upgraded Dynamics GP and your company data to the latest version of Dynamics GP.

## Backups

You should make at least one complete backup of your system database and each company database after upgrading to Dynamics GP.

## Reconciling financial data

Use the Reconcile Financial Information window to reset the summary amounts for each year.

To reconcile financial data:

1. Open the Reconcile Financial Information window. (Financial &gt;&gt; Utilities &gt;&gt; Financial &gt;&gt; Reconcile)

2. Select a year to reconcile.

3. Choose Reconcile.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the years in General Ledger have been reconciled.

## Checking links for currency tables

Use the Check Links window to check relationships among tables to find information that may be missing from one table within the relationship. You must check links for the Multicurrency Setup table even if you are not registered for Multicurrency Management.

To check links for currency tables:

1. Open the Check Links window.
(Dynamics GP menu &gt;&gt; Maintenance &gt;&gt; Check Links)

2. In the Series list, be sure that Financial is displayed.

3. In the Logical Tables list, select Multicurrency Setup and choose Insert to insert it into the Selected Tables list.

4. Choose OK to check links.

## Discontinuing the DexSQL.log

You should discontinue using the DexSQL.log file after the upgrade process. The DexSQL.log is a helpful tool that captures SQL operations and can provide information if there are issues during the upgrade process.

To discontinue the DexSQL.log:

1. Open the Dex.ini file in the Data folder of the Dynamics GP folder.

2. Change the following statements to FALSE.

    SQLLogSQLStmt=TRUE

    SQLLogODBCMessages=TRUE

    SQLLogAllODBCMessages=TRUE

3. Save your changes.

## Reports you should print after upgrading

After you upgrade, we recommend printing the following reports to a printer or to a file. You can use them to verify that your system was upgraded properly, or to re-create modifications.

Print this report only if you’re keeping history.

## Removing the previous release

You should remove the previous release from your computer by using your operating system’s Add/Remove Programs utility. This includes the reports dictionary and program files for integrating products from the previous release. After removing the release, use Windows Explorer to find and delete the folder where the release was installed.

To remove Dynamics GP, use your operating system’s Add/Remove Programs utility, and select Dynamics GP.

## Security for Dynamics GP

Refer to the Planning for Security document (Help &gt;&gt; Printable Manuals &gt;&gt; select Planning for Security) or to the System Setup Guide (Help &gt;&gt; Contents &gt;&gt; select Setting up the System) for more information about security.

New users, by default, will not have access to any Dynamics GP data. You can use the default security roles and tasks that are available, or you can create your own security roles and tasks to fit your company.

### Create security tasks

For new users, you must create security tasks for Workflow, purchase requisitions, Payroll timecards, and Project timesheets. You can use the Security Task Setup window to create those tasks. As a guide for the new tasks, review the following tasks that are created for new Dynamics GP installations.

## Security for SQL Server Reporting Services reports

After the upgrade, use Report Manager to grant access to additional reports deployed during the upgrade. You should also use the SQL Server Management Studio to assign user groups to the SQL Server database roles that correspond to the additional data connections and reports deployed during the upgrade. The user permissions assigned to the previous versions connections and reports are maintained during the upgrade process.

If you have deployed reports using the SharePoint integrated mode and have already assigned permissions to users, those same users will have access to report server items and operations immediately after you configure the integration settings between Microsoft SharePoint and a report server. You can use existing permissions to upload report definitions and other documents, view reports, create subscriptions, and manage items.

If you have not assigned permissions, assign user and group accounts to predefined SharePoint groups. You also can create new permission levels and groups or modify existing ones to vary server access permissions as specific needs arise.

You can deploy SQL Server Reporting Services reports for multiple Dynamics GP instances to a single Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Server. If you have deployed reports to a folder on a Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Server using the Native mode, you must to provide access to the folder.
