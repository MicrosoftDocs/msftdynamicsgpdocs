# Additional features and components upgrade

Depending on your organization's needs, you may have purchased additional features or components that add specialized functionality to your Dynamics GP system. After you've installed Dynamics GP and upgraded your data using Dynamics GP Utilities, you can install additional features and components that integrate with Dynamics GP.

## Dynamics GP features

After you've upgrade Dynamics GP, you may decide to purchase an additional feature or remove a feature. Some features add a single function to your Dynamics GP system while some, such as Manufacturing, allow you to complete a range of related business and accounting tasks that use one or more modules. Dynamics GP Utilities upgrades the tables for the features along with the Dynamics GP tables. If you choose to add a feature, we recommend that you install each registered Dynamics GP feature and additional component on all client computers. You can use the Select Features window to install or uninstall a feature. See the **Adding or removing additional features** section for more information.

### The following table lists the Dynamics GP features. The features available depends on the country or region you selected when installing Dynamics GP

## Adding or removing additional features

Use the installation wizard to add or remove features from your Dynamics GP installation. You also can use the Program Maintenance window, opened from the Add or Remove Programs control panel, to add or remove features. You should make a complete backup of your data before adding or removing features. Removing a feature does not remove tables from the database. Dynamics GP Utilities upgrades the tables for the feature along with the Dynamics GP tables.

You can't log in to Dynamics GP on a client computer if a component installed on the client has different version information than the server. You can use the GP\_LoginErrors.log file in your temporary directory to help resolve the version information issue. The log file will contain the product name, along with the dictionary version and the database version.

To add or remove additional features:

1. Start the installation wizard. You can use either of the following methods.

- From the Dynamics GP media, double-click the Setup.exe file. Click Dynamics GP. Select the existing instance of Dynamics GP in the Instance Selection window and click Next.

—or—

- Open the Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features or Uninstall a program. Select Dynamics GP. Click Change to open the Program Maintenance window.

2. Click Add/Remove Features.

3. In the Select Features window, select the features to install or uninstall. When you install a new feature, you won't reinstall features that have been installed previously.

### When you click a button for a feature, a pop-up menu of options appears. Refer to the table for more information about each option.

| Option                                                                         | What happens                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![component icon 1](media/installed-component.png "Component icon") Run from My computer     | The selected feature will be installed on the local hard disk. (This option installs the feature, but not sub–features.) |  
| ![component icon 2](media/installed-component.png "Component icon") Run all from My computer | Will install the feature and all of its sub–features.                                                                    |  
| ![component icon 3](media/not-installed-component.png "Component icon") Not available            | Will not install the selected feature or sub–features.                                                                   |  

After you have specified the feature or features, click Next.

4. In the Install Program window, click Install.

5. The Installation Progress window appears, where you can view the status of a feature.

6. In the Installation Complete window, click Exit.

7. Start Dynamics GP Utilities.

To start Dynamics GP Utilities, you must have appropriate user privileges. If you are using an operating system that has User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be prompted to run the program as a user with administrative privileges. Refer to your operating system's documentation for more information.

8. The Welcome To Dynamics GP Utilities window opens when you are logged into the server you selected. Read the message and click Next.

9. Follow the instructions in the Dynamics GP Utilities windows. Depending on the feature and whether you're installing the feature on your server or a client, you may have to upgrade tables and upgrade your companies and register the feature. You do not have to reapply the update for the features you selected.

10. After the upgrade process is finished, the Additional Tasks window opens, and you can perform additional tasks, start Dynamics GP, or exit the installation. See [Company data conversion](company-data-conversion.md) for more detailed information about each task in the Additional Tasks window.

## Additional components

A smaller set of additional products or components are separate installations available on the Dynamics GP media. These additional components are listed in the main Dynamics GP installation window.
